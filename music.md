# Bands

My wife and I are musicians. She is the better, but I have just as much fun anyway. I have been in many bands over the years, mostly with her. Here are the names I can remember.

- Moontan
- Boogie Chillun
- Chrome Naked Lady
- Cartoon Physics
- Concert Tease
- The Wonder Twins

All of them are defunct now except The Wonder Twins. The band Chrome Naked lady was named after those little chrome reclining lady ornaments you might see on the mudflap of a semi truck. Chrome Naked Lady played at least twice at Rock Island Brewing Company (Ribco) in Moline, Illinois. We even did some original songs such as "Raise Your Beer to Rock".

Cartoon Physics is my favorite name among the bunch. I named it. I think I named all of them, but I'm not sure about The Wonder Twins. The name Cartoon Physics is an homage to the golden age of cartoons for us Gen-Xers: think Bugs Bunny and Scooby-Doo. When Wile-E-Coyote walks off a cliff, he does not fall until he looks down and notices that he is no longer standing on solid ground. He is suspended there until he breaks the fourth wall to amuse us with his reaction. Then he falls. _That_ is cartoon physics -- as opposed to the regular kind.

Concert Tease was an attempt to rekindle the fun of Cartoon Physics after we moved to Florida. We did not put the effort into it that we did CP, and we lost interest in it and switched to The Wonder Twins.

The Wonder Twins began as an acoustic duo in Illinois, but it really took off when we got to Florida. We played for a few years on the beaches. We then moved to the other side of Tampa Bay and began playing the local bar and restaurant scene. We built a bit of a following. Over time we added a drummer and then subtracted him later. The newest iteration is in the works, but I will be mostly playing drums now. See [Drums] below.

# Guitar

I picked up my first guitar in 1992 at age 19. I'm a tolerable guitar player for the kind of gigs we have played over the years. I'm not a great soloist. I would probably be a decent rhythm guitar player for a band with a better lead player. My axes right now include:

- Seagull acoustic
- Fender Acoustasonic -- custom shop, white, Telecaster-style.

# Drums

My older brother was a drummer. He passed away in 1999. He was 7 years older than me and a role model as long as he was alive. We had a similar sense of humor and outlook on life in many ways. 

Over the years, I noodled with the drums enough to have a bit of ability when I decided in 2023 to become a drummer. The impetus was this: playing drums was my best chance to play music with my wife on cruise ships. She is a piano player. To learn piano was too daunting. But with my history of playing drums, my ear for how songs go in my head, and a little bit of skill from my history with my brother, I took to the drums. I bought a white Pearl drum kit and built a pretty unique looking Gibraltar rack system for it.
