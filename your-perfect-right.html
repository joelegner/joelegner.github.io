<h1 class="title">Your Perfect Right</h1>
<p class="author">Joe Legner</p>
<p class="date">August 04, 2023</p>
</header>
<p>I am reading a book called <em>Your Perfect Right</em>, Tenth
Edition, by Robert Alberti, PhD and Michael Emmons, PhD. It is about
improving your life through skill-building, especially assertiveness
training. It is essentially a manifesto about why you should be
assertive in life rather than the polar opposites of aggressive and
passive. It is truly a “middle way” between aggressiveness and
passivity.</p>
<p>Since they are polar opposite, they slope away from each other.
Whatever outcomes are produced by aggressiveness decline the closer you
get to passivity.</p>
<p>Being at the middle, you have none of the aggressive behavior
outcomes and none of the passive behavior outcomes. How so? What other
category of outcome is there beyond these two?</p>
<p>I say it is <em>rational</em> outcomes. I say it is outcomes
resulting from the best use of reason you can muster. It is the outcomes
you get when you follow your reason as far as she will take you.</p>
<p>Aggression is okay when it is rational to be aggressive. Say you
rationally assess a situation and judge that a little aggressiveness
might scare off a would-be mugger. Would it not be rational to be a
little aggressive? You’re just playing the odds. You are betting that
you will have a better outcome if you <em>choose</em> to be
aggressive.</p>
<p>Maybe anger is when you are aggressive, but it is not your choice.
You could not retroactively explain why it made sense to be aggressive
in that scenario, unlike the purly-rational mugger scaring stunt.
Irrational anger is a problem. Rational anger is assertiveness.
Assertiveness is rational anger.</p>
<p>Passiveness is okay when it is rational to be passive. Suppose you
are waiting for a hotel desk clerk to check you in. It is rational to be
passive and wait idle while the clerk does their work. (Ooh, the clerk
does work – clerk work). It is polite. It will garner better cooperation
from the other person. The transaction will go more smoothly if both
parties respect each other. Reciprocal respect is the order of the day.
And often it is necessary to be a little passive, but not overly
passive, in support of larger goals, like not getting thrown out of a
hotel.</p>
<p>Anyway, the book offers more and better analysis than this, so let’s
get to it.</p>
<h1 id="the-goals">The Goals</h1>
<p>The goals of this strange experiment include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>See if I retain information better when I actively summarize. This is
the hypethesis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What would it look like if I was successful? I would be able to read
my summary and immediately bring to mind the entire work. That would be
a huge success. More likely at least remember the over-arching message
and themes of the book. The essence would be okay.</p>
<p>It could also result in a failed experiment if the added cost of
writing the summary was not worth the added benefit to learning.</p>
<h1 id="method-of-authorship">Method of Authorship</h1>
<p>Each time I read the book, I will spend 15-25 minutes reading and
simultaneously writing this summary. I will get the book, open this VS
Code session, and begin to type after the first paragraph.</p>
<p>The goal is to summarize the book. Here are some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the entire passage, then summarize it, returning to the text
as-needed.</li>
<li>Read the passage and summarize it at the same time.
<ul>
<li>Summarize each paragraph with one complete sentence, then add some
filler in between them as-needed to make it flow.</li>
<li>Summarize as the spirit moves you. This is probably the better
way.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="summary-to-date">Summary to Date</h1>
<p>TODO: Start here on Saturday, August 5, or whenever the spirit moves
you to do it later, or never.</p>
