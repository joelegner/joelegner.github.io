            <h1>Read this website to make life better.</h1>

            <dl class="qa">
                <dt>If I read this website, what can I hope to get?</dt>
                <dd>A better life.</dd>

                <dt>Seriously?</dt>
                <dd>Yes. But bear with me!</dd>

                <dt>Who made this website?</dt>
                <dd>My name is Joe Legner. I conceived, planned, wrote, and published this website as you see it presently.</dd>

                <dt>How should I read this for maximum benefit?</dt>
                <dd>
                    1. Read it once, all the way through, without stopping for understanding. If you had to explain it to someone on the phone in 15 seconds or less, what would you say?
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    2. Read each question that interests you more slowly. If you asked this question, how would you put it? What is your answer to this question in your own words?
                </dd>

                <dt>When did I most recently publish this?</dt>
                <dd>Tuesday, February 24, 2026 at 2:30 PM.</dd>

                <dt>Why did I publish this site?</dt>
                <dd>To help whoever reads it.</dd>

                <dt>How do I structure the site?</dt>
                <dd>By question and answer.</dd>

                <dt>
                    How will reading this website make life better?
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    You will understand how Joe Legner thinks and why he talks the way he talks.
                </dd>

                <dt>How will understanding Joe Legner better make life better?</dt>
                <dd>You will have a better relationship with him. Relationships are built on understanding. If you read this website, you will understand, which improves the relationship.</dd>

                <dt>How does an improved relationship make life better?</dt>
                <dd>An improved relationship leads away from arguments and toward peace. And improved relationship leads away from bad feelings and toward good feelings.</dd>

                <dt>How do all those things I said about improving the relationship make life better?</dt>
                <dd>They reduce suffering.</dd>

                <dt>Why do I want to reduce suffering?</dt>
                <dd>To obey Joe’s prime directive.</dd>

                <dt>Why do I obey Joe’s prime directive?</dt>
                <dd>Because I choose to.</dd>


                <dt>What do I mean when I say "Joe's Prime Directive"?</dt>
                <dd>The primary rule I live by.</dd>

                <dt>How do I state Joe's Prime Directive</dt>
                <dd>Reduce suffering.</dd>

                <dt>How do I define the word "suffering"?</dt>
                <dd>Sense 1. The pain of living.</dd>
                <dd>
                    Sense 2. The abstraction of physical pain to include
                    emotional and mental.
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    Sense 3. The feeling of not accepting things as they are.
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    Sense 4. The feeling I get when I have something I don't
                    want or the similar feeling I get when I want something I
                    don't have.
                </dd>

                <dt>How do I describe my idea of suffering?</dt>
                <dd>
                    The feeling that goes with pain in body, heart, or mind.
                </dd>                

                <dt>What is my idea of understanding?</dt>
                <dd>
                    The mental equivalent of being close enough to a statue to
                    be able to describe it well in your own words. The mental
                    idea is the statue. Your understanding is your detailed
                    description of it.
                </dd>

                <dt>How do I imagine the idea of “idea”?</dt>
                <dd>
                    As a statue in a plaza which can be seen from many
                    different, literal, points of view.
                </dd>

                <dt>How do I imagine the idea of “point of view”?</dt>
                <dd>
                    One of the places someone is standing while looking at the
                    statue we call “idea”.
                </dd>

                <dt>
                    How do I imagine the idea of the word “point” in the phrase,
                    “she was making a point”?
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    A person standing at a particular point of view points their
                    finger at a feature of the statue we call “idea” while they
                    are talking to describe it. Making a point is visualized as
                    pointing with a finger.
                </dd>

                <dt>Why all this metaphor about a statue?</dt>
                <dd>
                    I have a vague hypothesis that this is the clearest, most
                    direct way to understand concepts.
                </dd>

                <dt>How do I believe I can have good relationships?</dt>
                <dd>Care enough to work to mutual understanding.</dd>

                <dt>How do I define "mutual understanding"?</dt>
                <dd>Two people who can say in their own words what the other one is thinking and feeling and why.</dd>

                <dt>What is the key to good judgment?</dt>
                <dd>Achieve understanding before you even think of judging.</dd>

                <dt>What is the most common cause of bad judgment?</dt>
                <dd>Judging before one understands.</dd>

                <dt>How do I know when I understand someone else?</dt>
                <dd>
                    They tell me what I say is complete and correct. They might
                    say “exactly”. They might say, “you’ve got it”.
                </dd>

                <dt>Why do I put questions like those below at the bottom of the page?</dt>
                <dd>They are the least important answers.</dd>

                <dt>Who is my audience?</dt>
                <dd>You.</dd>

                <dt>Who is my audience stated more fully?</dt>
                <dd>All humans, but especially the following. Myself. My wife. My two kids. My extended family. My friends. My acquaintances. My neighbors. My fellow citizens. Anglophones. </dd>


                <dt>How do I identify?</dt>
                <dd>Individual member of the human population.</dd>

                <dt>Where do I live, politically?</dt>
                <dd>
                    State of Florida. United States of America. North America. Western Hemisphere. Northern Hemisphere. Western World. 
                </dd>

                <dt>Where do I live, physically?</dt>
                <dd>
                    House. Lot. Peninsula. American supercontinent. Planet Earth. Planet Earth's solar system. Orion Arm of Milky Way galaxy. Milky Way galaxy. Virgo Supercluster. Laniakea Supercluster. The Universe.
