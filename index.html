                <dt>What do I mean when I say "Joe's Prime Directive"?</dt>
                <dd>The primary rule I live by.</dd>

                <dt>How do I state Joe's Prime Directive</dt>
                <dd>Reduce suffering.</dd>

                <dt>How do I define the word "suffering"?</dt>
                <dd>Sense 1. The pain of living.</dd>
                <dd>
                    Sense 2. The abstraction of physical pain to include
                    emotional and mental.
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    Sense 3. The feeling of not accepting things as they are.
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    Sense 4. The feeling I get when I have something I don't
                    want or the similar feeling I get when I want something I
                    don't have.
                </dd>

                <dt>How do I describe my idea of suffering?</dt>
                <dd>
                    The feeling that goes with pain in body, heart, or mind.
                </dd>

                <dt>What is my idea of understanding?</dt>
                <dd>
                    The mental equivalent of being close enough to a statue to
                    be able to describe it well in your own words. The mental
                    idea is the statue. Your understanding is your detailed
                    description of it.
                </dd>

                <dt>How do I imagine the idea of “idea”?</dt>
                <dd>
                    As a statue in a plaza which can be seen from many
                    different, literal, points of view.
                </dd>

                <dt>How do I imagine the idea of “point of view”?</dt>
                <dd>
                    One of the places someone is standing while looking at the
                    statue we call “idea”.
                </dd>

                <dt>
                    How do I imagine the idea of the word “point” in the phrase,
                    “she was making a point”?
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    A person standing at a particular point of view points their
                    finger at a feature of the statue we call “idea” while they
                    are talking to describe it. Making a point is visualized as
                    pointing with a finger.
                </dd>

                <dt>Why all this metaphor about a statue?</dt>
                <dd>
                    I have a vague hypothesis that this is the clearest, most
                    direct way to understand concepts.
                </dd>

                <dt>What is the key to all relationships?</dt>
                <dd>Understand. Mutual understanding.</dd>

                <dt>What is the key to good judgment?</dt>
                <dd>Achieve understanding before you even think of judging.</dd>

                <dt>What is the most common cause of bad judgment?</dt>
                <dd>Judging before one understands.</dd>

                <dt>How do I know when I understand someone else?</dt>
                <dd>
                    They tell me what I say is complete and correct. They might
                    say “exactly”. They might say, “you’ve got it”.
                </dd>

                <dt>Why do I put questions like those below at the bottom of the page?</dt>
                <dd>They are the least important answers.</dd>

                <dt>When did I first conceive this website?</dt>
                <dd>Monday, February 23, 2026 at 10:45 PM.</dd>
