Knowing something about formal axiology gives a person insight into how human beings come up with valuations for things. It makes clear why one object might have more value than another. The study of valuation is called axiology. 

Professor Robert S. Hartman wrote an axiom and created a branch of philophy called "formal axiology". The _formal_ part is because it is stated in formal language, like mathematics. Formal things can be applied universally. As long as something fits the form, it is valid. Formal axiology, then, is a way of thinking about value that can be universally applied, for it is axiomatic like mathematics. 

Here is the axiom:

> "Value is the degree in which a thing fulfills the attributes contained in the intension of its concept." -- Robert S. Hartman

To begin to understand this odd statement, we need to know a few things about how he is using words.

value
: What something is worth, to an agent making a valuation, in a particular context.

thing
: A real-world object that is an instance of a concept.

attribute
: A part, component, feature, or property of something.

concept
: 1. Anything we can talk about.
: 2. A name.

intension
: The set of attributes implied by a concept.

We make value judgments all the time, but we do not think about things this way. So why is it helpful to know what Professor Hartman said about the subject? 

Hartman claims that he discovered the key to how humans _actually_ make judgments. He is not inventing a way to make judgments. His explanation for how valuation works is that the person (subconsicously) retrieves all they know about a concept, compare the properties of the real-world instance to the attributes of the concept, and tally them up. The object that has more of the attributes is better than the one that has fewer.

Consider two cars. They are identical in every single way except one: Car A has no front left tire, while Car B does. Which one has greater value? Car B obviously does. But how did we arrive at that conclusion?

Hartman says we arrive at that conclusion by adding up the properties of cars belonging to each instance: Car A and Car B. We note that Car A is lacking many properties (attributes) that Car B embodies: the tire and the function of driving are two big examples. Car B has more properties of "carness" than Car A, so Car B is more valuable.

Hartman goes on to say that the ratio of values is measured by the _number_ of attributes exemplified by the individual object. Every attribute is worth one. Higher-level attributes contain lower-level attributes. This part is fuzzy to me today.

Hartman would say he invented a _science_ of value. He calls it a science, because it is derived from axioms. Philosophy, on the other hand, is based upon categories, not axioms. Categories are poorly defined. Axioms are crisp and unambiguous. Categories are extracted from observations of reality. Axioms are declared. 

A concept is a name that carries along with it property names. The norm of each thing is itâ€™s name. Norm equals name.

Categories contain implications. Axioms contain explications.

Philosophy creates implications. Science creates explications.

Concepts carry property names. Properties have names. Properties are predicates.
Properties are hierarchical. Properties have properties. So properties are concepts.

The degree to which a property is fulfilled by an object can be calculated precisely. If chair has $n_0$ properties and Chair A fulfills $n = n_0$ properties then Chair A is labeled "good." A "fair" chair has $n > n_0/2$. A "bad" chair has $n < n_0$. An "average" chair has $n = n_0/2$. 

In general, if a concept has $n$ properties it has $2^n-1$ subsets of properties and each subset is a value.
