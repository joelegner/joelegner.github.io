Formal axiology is a way of thinking about value that can be universally applied, for it is axiomatic like mathematics. 

The axiom of formal axiology was written by Robert S. Hartman. Here is the way he said it.

> "Value is the degree in which a thing fulfills the attributes contained in the intension of its concept." -- Robert S. Hartman

This is hard to grasp. We know what "value" is -- it is what something is worth. What is this bit about attributes and intensions? You can think about intension as the idea behind the thing. It's the set of properties that a thing of that kind has. Those properties are the attributes.

Let's talk about a concrete example. If you know this thing is a car, you can think about what attributes it probably has. A car is made of metal, plastic, and rubber. A car has four wheels. A car has a motor and control systems. A car has a passenger compartment. These things are the attributes of the concept.
