<h1 id="set-goals-and-work-toward-them">Set goals and work toward
them</h1>
<p>Have a few short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals in life. Make
a plan for each one. Go out and execute your plan. Enjoy when you
achieve a goal. Learn from your mistakes. Goals bring long-term
satisfaction.</p>
<p>Pick goals that will help you exemplify your core values. Work toward
them. Go on adventures. Enrich your life by stimulating yourself with
new creative things to do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“My fundamental goal is richness of life.” – Joe Legner</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Put your goals in ONE PLACE. Write goals in <strong>Apple
Reminders</strong>. Do not include goals in The Manual. Refer yourself
to Apple Reminders</p>
<p>Use the year and quarter as your goals. Review those lists regularly,
if not daily. This keeps the goals fresh in your mind. Check off those
you complete. Enjoy that feeling! Celebrate!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“One of the most dangerous forms of human error is forgetting what
one is trying to achieve.” – Paul Nietze<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Celebrate 85% to 95% goal achievement</strong>.</p>
<p>When you set a goal, <strong>think immediately about the steps needed
to achieve it</strong>. Make a plan. A plan is a series of events you
think will result in the desired outcome.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A goal without steps is merely a wish.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Caution: Do not worry too much about goals. Life is meant to be
lived. There is no “winning” at the end of things. You can win along the
way. But the end is just an end – an end of winning and an end of
losing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Life’s greatest prize is the game itself.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aspire to reach your goals – do not <em>expect</em> to achieve them.
Remember there are factors beyond your control that contribute to each
outcome. Cultivate a feeling of <em>aspirtation</em>. Be hopeful for
success but gracious in failure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you don’t achieve your goals, it’s okay. If you <em>do</em>
achieve your goals, it’s better.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Follow these steps for goal-seeking behavior:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Set goals. State them clearly. Make each one something that can be
independently verified.</li>
<li>Prioritize them.</li>
<li>For the top goal, write down the steps you will need to do to
achieve it. Remember, “A goal without steps is merely a wish.”</li>
<li>Once you complete a goal, do not go to the next one on the priority
list. Instead, re-prioritize the list.</li>
</ol>
<p>Use the ABC method of prioritizing goals:</p>
<div class="line-block">A = most important and most urgent<br />
B = less important and less urgent<br />
C = least important and least urgent; hold in reserve”</div>
<p><a href="#do-the-right-thing">Do the right thing</a>. <a
href="#live-life">Live Life</a>.</p>
<h1 id="improve-the-manual">Improve The Manual</h1>
<p>Read the Manual. Revise it. Make it clear, direct, and helpful. Keep
it living.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add to it when you learn something new.</li>
<li>Take something away when it does not work.</li>
<li>Use <em>The Manual</em> to help yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#grow">Grow</a>. <a href="#live-life">Live Life</a>.</p>
<h1 id="exercise-regularly">Exercise regularly</h1>
<p>Go for a walk. Do it now if you are up for it. At any rate, walk
daily if you can. Work out with weights 2 or 3 times per week. Build
muscle. Build strength and endurance. Do some stretching. Keep your body
strong and limber.</p>
<p><a href="#do-the-right-thing">Do the right thing</a>. <a
href="#live-life">Live Life</a>.</p>
<h1 id="study-and-practice-piano">Study and practice piano</h1>
<p>Find some piano instruction in the form of videos and books. Study
them. Start with the basics. Treat piano like a percussion instrument.
Stay loose, always. Hold you hand in a natural position.</p>
<p>Remember these desidirata:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fun.</li>
<li>Sufficient skill to play a gig in front of people.</li>
<li>Posture that is low energy, sustainable.</li>
<li>Technique that reduces fatigue.</li>
<li>Technique that reduces risk of injury.</li>
</ul>
<p>Research these questions:</p>
