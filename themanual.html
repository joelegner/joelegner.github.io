<h1 id="use-goals-to-enrich-your-life">Use goals to enrich your
life</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>“My fundamental goal is richness of life.” – Joe Legner</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, set goals. That gives you something to do. Even a goal like,
“do nothing today” is a goal. Work toward them. Go on adventures. Enrich
your life by stimulating yourself with new creative things to do.</p>
<p>Write your goals down in Apple Reminders. Use the year and quarter as
your goals. Review those lists regularly, if not daily. This keeps the
goals fresh in your mind. Check off those you complete. Enjoy that
feeling! Celebrate!</p>
<p>Target 85% to 95% goal achievement. Anything lower, and you are
probably not living life to the fullest. Anything higher, you are
pushing yourself too hard. Stay in a sweet spot of sustainable effort,
even pleasant effort, without burnout.</p>
<p>Remember when you are looking at your to-do list at the end of the
day, “Perfection is overshooting the mark.” If you do
<em>everything</em> on your to-do list, you are overshooting the mark.
Relax a little.</p>
<p>When you set a goal, think immediately about the steps needed to
achieve it. Make a plan. A plan is a series of events you think will
result in the desired outcome.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A goal without steps is merely a wish.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="be-realistic">Be realistic</h1>
<p>Be realistic at all times. Do not fight nature. Avoid extreme
judgments. Open your mind to nuance. Things are almost never – maybe
<em>always</em> never – one thing. There is almost always – probably
<em>always</em> – more than one way to look at things.</p>
<p>Be realistic when considering medication. Consider this observation
learned by reading <em>ADHD 2.0</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some medications work in some people at some dose, some of the
time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember this as an example of being realistic.</p>
<h2 id="act-feel-imagine-think">Act, Feel, Imagine, Think</h2>
<p>Remember you can only do these four things. They are not mutually
exclusive. They are rather intertwined. But what else can you do?
Nothing that I can think of.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Act</strong>: Do something with your body. The rest support
this.</li>
<li><strong>Feel</strong>: Experience emotions. Experience positive and
negative valency of the emotions. Experience moods.</li>
<li><strong>Imagine</strong>: Picture mental images in your head.</li>
<li><strong>Think</strong>: Talk to yourself, either inwardly or
outwardly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="be-optimistic">Be optimistic</h2>
<p>You might as well be optimistic. Remember not to feel
<em>entitled</em> to things going well. You do not <em>expect</em> them
to go well, but you <em>aspire</em> to it. Being optimistic probably has
a positive effect on the probability of success.</p>
<h2 id="avoid-perfectionism">Avoid perfectionism</h2>
<p>You are not perfect. Nobody is. Avoid trying to be perfect. If you
feel that you <em>have to</em> be perfect, the fact that you are
assuredly not perfect will result in you being chronically disappointed
in yourself. This is a problem. It leads to depression and feelings of
inadequacy. It is not conducive to achieving your goals. Be imperfect.
Be okay with being imperfect.</p>
<h1 id="spend-time-wisely">Spend time wisely</h1>
<p>Spend time in ways that support your goals, uphold your values, and
exemplify the kind of person you aspire to be. Spend time enjoying your
wife and kids. Spend some time with friends. Set lunch dates so you see
them. Seeing them is good for you, and it is good for them. Spend time
on creative pursuits, like writing. This is good therapy. Spend time
enjoying yourself. Remember you are still Joe <em>fucking</em> Legner.
Be that guy. He is pretty cool. He is a good guy. Spend time practicing
skills – drums, guitar, programming. Spend time learning. Spend time
mediating.</p>
<h1 id="remember-the-purpose-of-the-manual">Remember the purpose of The
Manual</h1>
<p>Remember the purpose of <em>The Manual</em> is to help you live a
better life. Choose what “better” means and work toward it. Put in
effort. Read this manual. Keep it alive.</p>
<h1 id="remember-the-format-of-the-manual">Remember the format of The
Manual</h1>
<p>The author is the audience. I am the audience. You are the audience.
We are the same person. Nice to meet you. Consider this advice you give
to yourself. It is things to keep in mind as you live your life. Each
section is a tip, a reminder, advice.</p>
<h1 id="keep-rewriting-each-heading-as-advice">Keep rewriting each
heading as advice</h1>
<p>You started a major re-write on January 19, 2024. Some of the
headings are advice to yourself. They are in the <em>imperative
mood</em>. That means they are instructions to yourself. Each one can be
prefixed with the word “You” which in this case means “You, Joe Legner,
keep rewriting each heading as advice.”</p>
<p>When you are done rewriting all of them, replace this section with
“Write new headings as advice.” That way you will maintain consistency
of style. If they are not consistent, it will cause you mental
dissonance which will distract you from your goals.</p>
<h1 id="get-better-at-life-by-reading-this">Get better at life by
reading this</h1>
<p>Read <em>The Manual</em> to get better at life.</p>
<h1 id="keep-this-manual-always-fresh">Keep this manual always
fresh</h1>
<p>To use the manual, read it regularly. Add to it. Revise it. Keep it
living.</p>
<h2 id="understand-what-formatting-communicates">Understand what
formatting communicates</h2>
<p>Read and understand the typesetting rules.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bold</strong> – headings; important topics; defined terms;
examples</li>
<li><strong><em>Bold Italics</em></strong> – questions</li>
<li><em>Italics</em> – emphasis; book titles</li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org">Whatever this color is</a> – external
hyperlinks</li>
<li><a href="#typesetting">Blue</a> – internal hyperlinks</li>
<li>ALL CAPS – axioms; principles</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="construct-a-worldview-that-works-for-you">Construct a worldview
that works for you</h1>
<p>Your worldview is the sum total of everything you believe. You want
it to contain information and wisdom that helps you thrive. Think about
your worldview explicitly. Once in a while try to write it down in your
own words. Let it evolve and grow as you gain experience and learn from
it.</p>
<h1 id="adopt-some-foundational-principles">Adopt some foundational
principles</h1>
<dl>
<dt>principle</dt>
<dd>
<ol start="14" type="a">
<li>A fundamental assumption, opinion, or guiding belief; rule to filter
for solutions to a problem; rule of conduct (“good or ill”).</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>One component of a worldview are what you might call
<em>principles</em>. The word <em>principle</em> means first. Be slow to
change your principles, but be willing to change them. Sometimes you
learn something about the world you did not know. At those times,
re-read these principles. See if they still work for you. If they don’t,
change them.</p>
<p>After each principle is a set of beliefs that go with it. Adopt these
principles and benefit yourself and others.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>SEE FOR YOURSELF PRINCIPLE. Trust your own experience. Only trust
others if you cannot see for yourself. Verify your assumptions if you
can. When you make assumptions, make them realistic ones. Consider even
this work, which you wrote, no less. You do not have to believe what is
in it. You can <em>change</em> your mind.</li>
<li>COMPASSION PRINCIPLE. Humans suffer. Be nice to them.</li>
<li>SMART AND FUN PRINCIPLE. Do things that make sense. If you do not
know if something makes sense, try to find out. Learn the rules of
logic. But do not follow rationality perfectly. That’s boring. Be fun,
too. Be smart and fun.</li>
<li>ACCEPTANCE OF CHANGE PRINCIPLE. Be ready for change to occur. Be
accepting when it does occur. Recognize what is changing. Think about
how it affects your thriving. Adapt to it. Remember: “Everything
changes.” Nothing is permanent. Even this principle is subject to
change. Revise a principle when is no longer useful, helpful, functional
in your life.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="learn-and-practice-communication-skills">Learn and practice
communication skills</h1>
<h2 id="use-i-messages">Use “I-messages”</h2>
<p>Two-part I-message model:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I feel <code>feeling</code> when
<code>event that caused the feeling</code>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Try to word the event in neutral terms. Do not use it as a
passive-aggressive way to dig at the other person. For example, “I feel
angry because of what you’re saying about me” is better than, “I feel
angry because you are trying to hurt me.”</p>
<h2 id="when-angry-pause">When angry, pause</h2>
<p>When angry, pause before communicating. Do not send an email while
your blood is boiling. Step away. Take some time to cool off. Send it
when cool, not hot.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When angry, count 10 before you speak. If very angry, a hundred.” –
Thomas Jefferson.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you speak when angry, you’ll make the best speech you’ll ever
regret.” – Grocho Marx.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="remember-not-communicating-is-communication">Remember
<em>not</em> communicating is communication</h2>
<p>You cannot help but communicate. Evading a communication still
communicates something to the other person. This is an important
insight. Non-communication is still communication. It is impossible not
to communicate. Knowing this, it makes sense to <em>choose</em> to
communicate. Then choose how and do it. See the results and gain
experience from that cycle.</p>
<h1 id="put-some-effort-into-mastering-the-english-language">Put some
effort into mastering the English Language</h1>
<p>One form of communication so far seems only to belong to humans. It
is language – talking. Writing was developed after spoken language. It
tries to represent spoken language on the page. It is less perfect, but
it has some great advantages that outweigh its costs. This document is
written in English<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. To understand and benefit from the
document, you need to understand English. Without understanding English,
you will not understand The Manual.</p>
<h2 id="use-these-websites-to-generate-your-personal-definitions">Use
these websites to generate your personal definitions</h2>
<p>As part of your worldview, you adopt definitions. Make the
definitions as good as you can by using these websites.</p>
<p>Use the websites to find definitions. If you have the time, do not
stop when you find the first definition. Find two to five, write them
all down, and stare at them. See what jumps out. What is the
<em>essence</em> of the several meanings?</p>
<p>Write down your final definition here in <em>The Manual</em> so you
can find it later when you re-read it.</p>

under [Find Definitions Online] gave these results.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A cohesive whole built up of distinct parts.</li>
<li>The overall form or organization of something.</li>
<li>A set of rules defining behavior.</li>
<li>(computing) Several pieces of data treated as a unit.</li>
<li>(fishing, uncountable) Underwater terrain or objects (such as a dead
tree or a submerged car) that tend to attract fish.</li>
<li>A body, such as a political party, with a cohesive purpose or
outlook.</li>
<li>Arrangement of parts, of organs, or of constituent particles, in a
substance or body; as, the structure of a rock or a mineral; the
structure of a sentence.</li>
<li>Manner of organization; the arrangement of the different tissues or
parts of animal and vegetable organisms; as, organic structure, or the
structure of animals and plants; cellular structure.</li>
<li>A thing constructed; a complex entity constructed of many
parts.</li>
<li>The complex composition of knowledge as elements and their
combinations.</li>
<li>A particular complex anatomical part of a living thing and its
construction and arrangement)</li>
<li>The people in a society considered as a system organized by a
characteristic pattern of relationships</li>
</ol>
<p>You asked yourself, “What do we get from this list?” You wrote down
that a structure is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Cohesive whole, unit, form, organization</li>
<li>Made up of parts; arrangement of parts; set of parts</li>
<li>Relationship of parts to each other matters</li>
<li>Has tendencies; behaves</li>
</ol>
<p>You asked, “Can we roll this into our own definition?” This is what
you wrote in response:</p>

<dt>structure</dt>
<dd>
<ol start="14" type="a">
<li>Parts arranged into a recognizable whole that behaves as a

<h1 id="understand-better-with-physical-metaphors">Understand better
with physical metaphors</h1>
<p>Ground your concepts in physical metaphors. Remember metaphors like
<em>UP IS MORE</em> and <em>TIME IS AN OBJECT MOVING FROM FRONT TO
BACK</em>. Notice how these are used in the language. When other people
use them, they understand them similar to the way you do. If they are
from another culture, they might have different metaphors. Be prepared
in case they do.</p>
<h2 id="help-others-understand-metaphors">Help others understand
metaphors</h2>
<p>Because you are SMART AND FUN, understand that knowing metaphors is
helpful, and you want to help others because of your COMPASSION
PRINCIPLE it makes sense to remember the details about a few metaphors.
This will help you teach them.</p>
<p>Remember they are about the human form walking forward on a journey –
a way to a goal (the place where you stop). They are in a direction
(value).</p>
<p>Some metaphors are orientational. They are based upon the upright
walking posture of a human body. When the human is healthy and alert,
the human is erect, alert, energetic, upright, or generally <em>up</em>.
The head is high. When the human is unhealthy or lethargic, the human is
slumped, slouched, sitting, drooping, or generally <em>down</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>COMMUNICATION IS SENDING</li>
<li>CONTROL IS UP – He is above me in the company. She is at the
top.</li>
<li>IDEAS ARE FOOD</li>
<li>IDEAS ARE OBJECTS</li>
<li>LIFE IS A CONTAINER</li>
<li>LIFE IS A GAMBLING GAME</li>
<li>LINGUISTIC EXPRESSIONS ARE CONTAINERS</li>
<li>RATIONAL ARGUMENT IS WAR – She attacked his position. I found my
position hard to defend. At that point, my adversary was on the
defensive.</li>
<li>THEORIES ARE BUILDINGS – Her theory was built on shaky foundations.
We start with the basics and build upon them until we have built the
entire theory.</li>
<li>TIME IS A MOVING OBJECT – The time will come. Next week is almost
here. Two years ago we left our problems behind.</li>
<li>TIME IS MONEY<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
<li>UNDERSTANDING IS GRASPING</li>
<li>UP IS MORE</li>
<li>VISUAL FIELD IS A CONTAINER – The boat sailed into view.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>How does knowing these metaphors help
me?</em></strong></p>
<p>You will be a better writer. You will understand the meaning of
others’ communications. You will therefore do better working toward your
goals, especially shared goals.</p>

create a <em>stellar environment</em> as they say in the book <em>ADHD

<ul>
<li>Cultivate a playful attitude; laugh.</li>
<li>Structure sufficiently to avoid chaos (entropy).</li>
<li>Eat meals together when possible.</li>
<li>Worry together – “No one should have to worry alone.”</li>
<li>Encourage self-assertion – no matter what. Speak what is kind,
truthful, timely, and wise.</li>
<li>Keep a pet around.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="benefit-from-the-lessons-of-act">Benefit from the lessons of
ACT</h1>
<p>ACT means Acceptance and Commitment Therapy.</p>
<p>Don’t struggle with thoughts and feelings. Accept them and take
committed action instead. To cultivate psychological flexibility, be
present, open up, and do what matters. To be present, connect with the
present moment and the knowing self. To open up, accept and unhook. To
do what matters, identify values and take committed action.</p>
<h1 id="be-pragmatic">Be pragmatic</h1>
<p>Consider what effects (which might have practical bearings) we
conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of
those effects is the whole of our conception of the object.</p>
<h1 id="value-things-according-to-formal-axiology">Value things
according to formal axiology</h1>
<p>Value is the degree in which a thing fulfills the attributes
contained in the intention of its concept.</p>
<p>Formal Axiology is also called the “Science of Value.”</p>
<h1 id="use-reason">Use reason</h1>
<p>Know what reason is. Know what its rules are. Use them to benefit you
in your goal-seeking behavior.</p>
<p>The basis of reason is the idea that one claim follows from others.
Deduction is reasoning from population to sample. It is deterministic
Induction is reasoning from sample to population. It is probabilistic.
Deduction is to reasoning as induction is to reasons.</p>
<p>Do not solely rely on reason. Richness of life demands more than cold
reason. Reason seldom excites the emotion. Yet the human is an emotional
creature. Be Kirk, not Spock.</p>
<h1 id="use-cost-benefit-model-to-decide">Use cost-benefit model to
decide</h1>
<p>You make many decisions. Some are easy: to take a shower or not. Some
are difficult: to go to college or not. A cost-benefit analysis is a way
to make rational decisions that <a href="#use-reason">Use
reason</a>.</p>
<p>How do you do it?</p>
<p>When you decide between options, consider the costs and the benefits.
Weigh the costs. Weigh the benefits. If the scale is not tipped in favor
of benefits, select something else (if you can). Be honest about the
tradeoffs.</p>

principles</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>STOP AT TENSION PRINCIPLE<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> – Play at all times with
relaxed muscles. Stop at the slightest feeling of tension. Control
begins with muscular relaxation. Strive to stay completely relaxed from
the neck, through the shoulders and arms, all the way down to the
fingers</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>START WITH YOUR GRIP PRINCIPLE – The first thing you must do to be a
drummer is grip the stick in the right way. See the 5 Basics video by
Mike Michalkow.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>PLAY FROM THE WRISTS PRINCIPLE - The wrists are the motor. Play from
the wrists, not the elbows. You use less energy that way. Do as little
work as possible. That way you will never tire out.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>RUDIMENTS FIRST PRINCIPLE<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> – Start each session
with rudiments. Rudiments are the key to everything else. Without a
solid handle on rudiments, the rest of your practice will be shaky.
Rudiments are the bedrock upon which you build your foundations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>TWENTY TIMES PRINCIPLE<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> – When practicing rudiments,
practice 20 times without stopping.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>METRONOME PRINCIPLE – A metronome keeps you honest. Practice with a
metronome at different speeds, varying from extremely slowly to top
speed, then back down to regular tempo again.</p>

<h2 id="warm-up-before-practicing">Warm up before practicing</h2>
<p>This is a 7-minute warmup.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Loosen your joints. Shake out your wrists for 15 to 30 seconds. Link
your hands together and rotate your wrists, 10 rounds in each direction.
Repeat these for 3 rounds.</li>
<li>Stretch forearms. Hold up your right arm with your palm facing away
from you. Using your left hand, pull your palm towards you, make sure
your elbow is extended and hold for 5 seconds. You should feel a stretch
along your lower forearm. Next, rotate your right hand down with the
palm facing you. Again, pull your palm towards you, hold for 5 seconds.
You should feel a stretch along your upper forearm. Repeat for your left
hand. Then, repeat this exercise 3 times.</li>
<li>Hand/fist stretches. With your hands in front of you, clench for
fists tightly for 3 seconds. Then open your hands as widely as you can
without moving your wrists and hold them there for 3 seconds. Repeat
this exercise 3 times.</li>
<li>Get a grip. Grip the drumstick at the first knuckle of the index
finger at the spot on the stick where it bounces the most when dropping
from horizontal.</li>
<li>For the rest of the session, strive to stay completely relaxed from
the neck, through the shoulders and arms, all the way down to the
fingers.</li>
<li>Play medium single-stroke roll for 1 minute. Start with sticks at 45
degrees to the drum. Pay special attention to the tips. Make sure they
rise to the same line every time. Start slow, gradually increase tempo.
At the 30-mark, start slowing down again.<br />
</li>
<li>Play rebounding double strokes for 2 minutes. Check grip by dropping
a stick to get only one extra bounce.</li>
<li>Play single stroke roll to double stroke roll for 2 minutes.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="master-single-stroke-rolls">Master single stroke rolls</h2>
<p>Master your single stroke roll. Practice at various tempos between 60
bpm and 180 bpm with eighth notes, triplets, and sixteenth notes.</p>
<h2 id="master-double-stroke-rolls">Master double stroke rolls</h2>
<p>Double stroke rolls seem to be important. Mike Michalkow says he has
to help the second beat at slow speeds, but at high speeds the rebound
takes care of the second beat, making the two equal. Don’t go too slow.
You have to go fast enough that the rebound works.</p>

<p>Time does not always have to be “managed.” Let’s get that straight
first. But if you find it <em>helpful</em> or <em>useful</em> to do
something to manager your time, you can use some of these tips. The
first batch is from an article called “Crux of Time Management for
Students” by Felix Bast.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Spend time on the right things<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"

the meandering things that come.</li>
<li>Use the Eisenhower Matrix to filter candidate activities.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="work-in-10-minute-chunks">Work in 10-minute chunks</h2>
<p>You want to practice things. You want to do productive things. You
sometimes avoid and evade, because you dread the time, effort, and
energy you will spend. By working things in defined, 10-minute bursts,
you will lose that resistance. You will also be very productive. Event
hough 10 minutes sounds short, it adds up if you do it daily.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>10 MINUTES DAILY IS 60 HOURS YEARLY</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let our daily benchmark be <strong>10 minutes per day</strong>.
Assuming you do not skip more than 2% of the days in the year (6 days),
this equates to <strong>60 hours per year</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>What about effort per workday instead?</em></strong></p>
<p>First determine how many work days per year you actually go to work.
At 5 days per week and 52 weeks per year, there are 260 potential work
days per year. We have about 12 holidays which reduces the number to 248
days. My vacation is approximately 4 weeks or 20 days. The final number
for planning is 228 days. Assuming again we do not miss more than 2% (4
days), we will do the activity 224 times in the year. Then <strong>10
minutes per work day</strong> equates to <strong>37 hours per
year</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>10 minutes per work day sums to 37 hours per calendar year.</p>
<p>It is now easy to scale these up and down to other times.</p>

habits? They can be nurtured. They need to be cared for to grow and
blossom.</p>
<p><em>How do we cultivate habits?</em></p>
<p>Use mindfulness practice. Focus attention on the small details. Do
not say derogatory things about them. Say positive things like, “I love
the feeling after I exercise.” Consider making a daily routine. Add
Apple Reminders. Add alarms.</p>

<h2 id="use-time-blocking">Use time-blocking</h2>
<p>The calendar can be a powerful tool. Time-block tasks. This prevents
other things from encroaching on them. It gives you the permission to
set aside all other things during that time. Once complete you will
likely feel a sense of accomplishment – a great feeling. You can forgive
yourself for not continuing to work on the task after the timer goes off
and you can stop.</p>
<p><strong><em>Follow these steps to use
time-blocking:</em></strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Trigger</strong>: Deciding to commit to a task.</li>
<li>Estimate the time and energy needed.</li>
<li>Look for spots on your calendar where you expect to have both the
time and energy.</li>
<li>Add a calendar appointment.</li>
<li>On the appointed day, at the appointed time, do the task.</li>
<li>If the task is incomplete at the end, repeat the process – that is,
if you are still committed to completing the job.</li>
<li>If the task is complete, celebrate!</li>

the wild. If you can, write the story here, so your future self can
benefit from it.</p>
<div class="line-block">…because I’m bigger than you
(intimidation)<br />
…because if you don’t, I’ll… (threat)<br />
…because I’m the boss, (authority)<br />
…because you’re stupid, (insult)<br />
…because you usually do it wrong, (belittling)<br />
…because I have as much right as you do. (challenging authority)<br />
…because I love you. (evading the issue) …<br />
…because if you will…, I’ll… (bargaining)<br />
…because you’re so much better at it (flattery)</div>
<p>Whenever you are striving to use rational argument, you have three
moves available:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Stating premises – making claims.</li>
<li>Citing supporting evidence.</li>
<li>Drawing logical conclusions – using induction or deduction. You can
also refer to this as <em>inference</em>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="write-like-a-pro">Write like a pro</h2>
<p>Use short words and short sentences. Eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A sentence should have no unnecessary words just as a machine should
have no unnecessary parts.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Make writing clear. That is the first priority. Know what your reader
cares about. Give it to them as quickly as you can and then support it
after that.</p>
<p>Read your writing out loud. If it does not sound good when read
aloud, revise it. Edit it. Re-read it after that and repeat.</p>
<p>Use the principle of BLUF – bottom line up front. In an email, this
means opening the email with the punchline. You might have one courtesy
sentence, but then get to the point.</p>
<p>When you write an email, your first line should answer this question
your reader will have: “Why did you write me an email (or a letter)?”
You need to prove to the reader in the first one or two sentences what
you offer them.</p>
<p>Only <em>after</em> BLUF do you explain your reasoning. Normally we
build up from details through our logic and then reach our conclusion.
We work from detailed to general. But when we <em>write</em> about that
process, we follow the opposite path. We start with the conclusion, then
we explain why we believe it, going from general to detailed.</p>

<p><strong><em>What is the advice?</em></strong></p>
<p>To write like Barbara Minto’s framework suggests, write from general
to specific. Start with the most general thing you know about the
subject. Make a statement about it – your primary claim. After that,
support each claim with additional claims. You can go several levels
deep this way, as needed.</p>
<p><strong><em>How will the advice help me?</em></strong></p>
<p>You will write better. You will communicate more effectively, because
you are using the natural abilities of the human mind. Your readers will
understand it best when it is presented as Barbara Minto suggested:</p>
<p><strong><em>Why should I believe the advice?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>What is the advice?</em></strong></p>
<p>When you write a paper of any kind, use this form:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Each level is a summary of the level below.</li>
<li>Each level contains the same <em>kinds</em> of things.</li>
<li>Each level is <em>logically ordered</em> (induction, deduction,
analogy, parts of a whole,metaphor, etc.)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><em>Why should I believe the advice?</em></strong></p>
