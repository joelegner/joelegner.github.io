<p>Your values are qualities of action. Ideally, you want your actions
to exhibit one or more of them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Adventure</li>
<li>Connection</li>
<li>Gratitude</li>
<li>Growth</li>
<li>Humility</li>
<li>Humor</li>
<li>Independence</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Adventure</strong> is about having fun! Go play. Play music.
Play in the dirt. Climb trees. Travel the globe. Meet new people. Try
new activities. Try new foods. Get out there and mix it up with some
randoms. <strong>Example:</strong> You played drums in Orlando on
Wednesday, January 17, 2024 with Julie and Emily.</p>
<p><strong>Connection</strong> is about other people. It is having
meaningful relationships of all kinds, especially with loved ones. It is
about connecting with people, seeing them as they really are, and
treating them with respect and compassion. <strong>Example:</strong> You
cared for Julie while she recovered from surgery – twice.</p>
<p><strong>Gratitude</strong> is giving thanks for the gifts you have.
So many things are right in your world. You have a healthy body. You
have a strong and healthy brain. You have a great marriage and two good
kids. Notice all the good things.</p>
<p><strong>Growth</strong> is about getting better over time. You
observe how things are going. You question things. You learn new
insights. You put those insights into practice.</p>
<p><strong>Humility</strong> is the belief that you are no better than
anyone else. You are a feeling human being, but everyone else is one
too. You are not better than them. They are not better than you. People
are incomparable.</p>
<p><strong>Humor</strong> is about coping with problems by laughing at
them. You can chuckle when things go wrong. You can use humor to make
fun of life’s mishaps.</p>
<p><strong>Independence</strong> is about your freedom. You are as
self-sufficient as can be. You assert your rights. You are not dependent
on others. <strong>Example:</strong> You are writing this manual.</p>
<p><strong>Growth</strong> is about getting wiser and better over time.
You are maturing as a person. You are gaining wisdom every day. New
experiences are the fertilizer that helps you grow.
<strong>Example:</strong> You started studying Swift on January 20,
2024.</p>
<h1 id="use-goals-to-enrich-your-life">Use goals to enrich your
life</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>“My fundamental goal is richness of life.” – Joe Legner</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, set goals. Pick goals that will help you exemplify your core
values. Work toward them. Go on adventures. Enrich your life by
stimulating yourself with new creative things to do.</p>
<p>Write your goals down in Apple Reminders. Use the year and quarter as
your goals. Review those lists regularly, if not daily. This keeps the
goals fresh in your mind. Check off those you complete. Enjoy that
feeling! Celebrate!</p>
<p>Here are the goal levels in Apple Reminders:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>2024</code> – Goals for 2024 live here until assigned to a
quarter. They live here until assigned to a quarter.</li>
<li><code>2024Q1</code> – Use these goals for now.</li>
<li><code>2024Q2</code> – When this quarter starts, move some incomplete
goals into it from either <code>2024</code> or <code>2024Q1</code>.</li>
<li><code>2024Q3</code> – When this quarter starts, move some incomplete
goals into it from either <code>2024</code> or <code>2024Q2</code>.</li>
<li><code>2024Q4</code> – When this quarter starts, move some incomplete
goals into it from either <code>2024</code> or <code>2024Q3</code>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“One of the most dangerous forms of human error is forgetting what
one is trying to achieve.” – Paul Nietze<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Target 85% to 95% goal achievement. Anything lower, and you are
probably not living life to the fullest. Anything higher, you are
pushing yourself too hard. Stay in a sweet spot of sustainable effort,
even pleasant effort, without burnout.</p>
<p>Remember when you are looking at your to-do list at the end of the
day, “Perfection is overshooting the mark.” If you do
<em>everything</em> on your to-do list, you are overshooting the mark.
Relax a little.</p>
<p>When you set a goal, think immediately about the steps needed to
achieve it. Make a plan. A plan is a series of events you think will
result in the desired outcome.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A goal without steps is merely a wish.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Caution: Do not worry too much about goals. Life is meant to be
lived. There is no “winning” at the end of things. You can win along the
way. But the end is just an end – an end of winning and an end of
losing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Life’s greatest prize is the game itself.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are some of your major goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be recognized as a great leader at TECO.</li>
<li>Be the best manager my boss ever had.</li>
<li>Be the best manager my team ever had.</li>
<li>Cultivate a happy marriage. </li>
<li>Get my two kids launched.</li>
<li>Get out of my day job.</li>
<li>Make engineering at TECO better than ever before.</li>
<li>Play music on a cruise ship.</li>
<li>Stay in-shape.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aspire to reach your goals – do not <em>expect</em> to achieve them.
Remember there are factors beyond your control that contribute to each
outcome. Cultivate a feeling of <em>aspirtation</em>. Be hopeful for
success but gracious in failure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you don’t achieve your goals, it’s okay. If you <em>do</em>
achieve your goals, it’s better.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Follow these steps for goal-seeking behavior:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Set goals. State them clearly. Make each one something that can be
independently verified.</li>
<li>Prioritize them.</li>
<li>For the top goal, write down the steps you will need to do to
achieve it. Remember, “A goal without steps is merely a wish.”</li>
<li>Once you complete a goal, do not go to the next one on the priority
list. Instead, re-prioritize the list.</li>
</ol>
<p>Use the ABC method of prioritizing goals:</p>
<div class="line-block">A = most important and most urgent<br />
B = less important and less urgent<br />
C = least important and least urgent; hold in reserve”</div>
<h1 id="assess-your-energy-and-act-accordingly">Assess your energy and
act accordingly</h1>
<p>You need these things to work toward a goal: (1) knowledge of what to
do, (2) desire to do it, (3) time, and (4) energy. This section is about
#4 – energy.</p>
<p>Rate your energy using the gas tank analogy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Full</strong>: Tasks that take great effort: exercising,
difficult problems that need thought. This is when you are at the peak
of your efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>3/4</strong>: Tasks that take effort: exercising,
studying.</li>
<li><strong>1/2</strong>: Tasks that take modest effort: laundry, doing
dishes, reading for productively.</li>
<li><strong>1/4</strong>: Mindless chores: expense reports, putting away
dishes, reading for pleasure. Eisenhower: Important + Not Urgent.</li>
<li><strong>Empty</strong>: Rest</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="be-realistic">Be realistic</h1>
<p>Be realistic at all times. Do not fight nature. Avoid extreme
judgments. Open your mind to nuance. Things are almost never – maybe
<em>always</em> never – one thing. There is almost always – probably
<em>always</em> – more than one way to look at things.</p>
<p>Be realistic when considering medication. Consider this observation
learned by reading <em>ADHD 2.0</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some medications work in some people at some dose, some of the
time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember this as an example of being realistic.</p>
<h1 id="act-feel-imagine-think">Act, Feel, Imagine, Think</h1>
<p>Remember you can only do these four things. They are not mutually
exclusive. They are rather intertwined. But what else can you do?
Nothing that I can think of.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Act</strong>: Do something with your body. The rest support
this.</li>
<li><strong>Feel</strong>: Experience emotions. Experience positive and
negative valency of the emotions. Experience moods.</li>
<li><strong>Imagine</strong>: Picture mental images in your head.</li>
<li><strong>Think</strong>: Talk to yourself, either inwardly or
outwardly.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="be-optimistic">Be optimistic</h1>
<p>You might as well be optimistic. Remember not to feel
<em>entitled</em> to things going well. You do not <em>expect</em> them
to go well, but you <em>aspire</em> to it. Being optimistic probably has
a positive effect on the probability of success.</p>
<h1 id="avoid-perfectionism">Avoid perfectionism</h1>
<p>You are not perfect. Nobody is. Avoid trying to be perfect. If you
feel that you <em>have to</em> be perfect, the fact that you are
assuredly not perfect will result in you being chronically disappointed
in yourself. This is a problem. It leads to depression and feelings of
inadequacy. It is not conducive to achieving your goals. Be imperfect.
Be okay with being imperfect.</p>
<h1 id="spend-time-wisely">Spend time wisely</h1>

</ul>
<p>Spend time in ways that support your goals, uphold your values, and
exemplify the kind of person you aspire to be. Spend time enjoying your
wife and kids. Spend some time with friends. Set lunch dates so you see
them. Seeing them is good for you, and it is good for them. Spend time
on creative pursuits, like writing. This is good therapy. Spend time
enjoying yourself. Remember you are still Joe <em>fucking</em> Legner.
Be that guy. He is pretty cool. He is a good guy. Spend time practicing
skills – drums, guitar, programming. Spend time learning. Spend time
mediating.</p>
<p>Try to budget time.</p>

<p>You have 1,000 minutes of awake time each day. You can check your
progress like this:</p>

<p>“How many minutes has it been since 7:00 am?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> At 6:45 p.m. on Saturday, January 27, 2024,
I asked her this, and she responded, “705 minutes.” That means I have
spent 70 cherries and have 30 left. Consider a logging app that keeps
track of the day as a progress bar.</p>
<h1 id="construct-a-worldview-that-works-for-you">Construct a worldview
that works for you</h1>
<p>Your worldview is the sum total of everything you believe. You want
it to contain information and wisdom that helps you thrive. Think about
your worldview explicitly. Once in a while try to write it down in your
own words. Let it evolve and grow as you gain experience and learn from
it.</p>
<h1 id="adopt-some-foundational-principles">Adopt some foundational
principles</h1>
<dl>
<dt>principle</dt>
<dd>
<ol start="14" type="a">
<li>A fundamental assumption, opinion, or guiding belief; rule to filter
for solutions to a problem; rule of conduct (“good or ill”).</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>One component of a worldview are what you might call
<em>principles</em>. The word <em>principle</em> means first. Be slow to
change your principles, but be willing to change them. Sometimes you
learn something about the world you did not know. At those times,
re-read these principles. See if they still work for you. If they don’t,
change them.</p>
<p>After each principle is a set of beliefs that go with it. Adopt these
principles and benefit yourself and others.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>SEE FOR YOURSELF PRINCIPLE. Trust your own experience. Only trust
others if you cannot see for yourself. Verify your assumptions if you
can. When you make assumptions, make them realistic ones. Consider even
this work, which you wrote, no less. You do not have to believe what is
in it. You can <em>change</em> your mind.</li>
<li>COMPASSION PRINCIPLE. Humans suffer. Be nice to them.</li>
<li>FUNCTIONAL PRINCIPLE. Judge performance based upon whether the
thought, feeling, or action is functional or <em>workable</em> for
goal-seeking.</li>
<li>SMART AND FUN PRINCIPLE. Do things that make sense. If you do not
know if something makes sense, try to find out. Learn the rules of
logic. But do not follow rationality perfectly. That’s boring. Be fun,
too. Be smart and fun.</li>
<li>ACCEPTANCE OF CHANGE PRINCIPLE. Be ready for change to occur. Be
accepting when it does occur. Recognize what is changing. Think about
how it affects your thriving. Adapt to it. Remember: “Everything
changes.” Nothing is permanent. Even this principle is subject to
change. Revise a principle when is no longer useful, helpful, functional
in your life.</li>
<li>UTILIZATION PRINCIPLE. Use things for what they are made for as much
as possible.</li>

<p>Two-part I-message model:</p>

<p>“I feel <code>feeling</code> when

<p>Try to word the event in neutral terms. Do not use it as a
passive-aggressive way to dig at the other person. For example, “I feel
angry because of what you’re saying about me” is better than, “I feel
angry because you are trying to hurt me.”</p>
<h1 id="pause-before-communicating-when-angry">Pause before

<p>When angry, pause before communicating. Do not send an email while
your blood is boiling. Step away. Take some time to cool off. Send it

<h1 id="remember-not-communicating-is-communication">Remember not

<p>You cannot help but communicate. Evading a communication still
communicates something to the other person. This is an important
insight. Non-communication is still communication. It is impossible not
to communicate. Knowing this, it makes sense to <em>choose</em> to
communicate. Then choose how and do it. See the results and gain

<p>Remember how you defined the word <em>structure</em>. The three tools

<ol type="1">
<li>A cohesive whole built up of distinct parts.</li>
<li>The overall form or organization of something.</li>
<li>A set of rules defining behavior.</li>
<li>(computing) Several pieces of data treated as a unit.</li>

<p>You asked yourself, “What do we get from this list?” You wrote down
that a structure is:</p>

<li>Made up of parts; arrangement of parts; set of parts</li>
<li>Relationship of parts to each other matters</li>

<h1 id="understand-metaphor">Understand metaphor</h1>
<p>Metaphor is a way to understand something in one domain by leveraging
your understanding of something in another domain.</p>
<p>Ground your concepts in physical metaphors. Remember metaphors like
<em>UP IS MORE</em> and <em>TIME IS AN OBJECT MOVING FROM FRONT TO
BACK</em>. Notice how these are used in the language. When other people
use them, they understand them similar to the way you do. If they are
from another culture, they might have different metaphors. Be prepared
in case they do.</p>
<p>Metaphor is related to categorization. The two share a continuum.</p>

<p><strong><em>How do we find meaning in metaphors?</em></strong></p>
<p>Seeing, light, physical force (physics), sick person, war, hidden
object, size (big, small), touching, containers, limbs, — in short all
things we need to understand (grasp) to operate successfully in a
physical world as a human being among other human beings: everyday
life.</p>
<p>Notice how in many cases the right side of the metaphor below is a
basic concept from everyday life: objects, containers, buildings,
journeys, resources, grasping, and directions (up, down).</p>
<p><strong><em>What metaphors do I live by?</em></strong></p>

<li>ACTIONS ARE OBJECTS</li>
<li>ACTIVITIES ARE SUBSTANCES</li>
<li>AN ACTIVITY IS A CONTAINER</li>
<li>ARGUMENTS ARE BUILDINGS</li>

<li>ARGUMENTS ARE JOURNEYS</li>
<li>BRAINS ARE MACHINES – My mind is not working right today. I could
see the gears grinding in her head.</li>
<li>COMMUNICATION IS SENDING</li>
<li>CONTROL IS UP – He is above me in the company. She is at the
top.</li>
<li>CREATION IS BIRTH – Birth seems to be the primeval source of
<em>make</em> and <em>create</em>.</li>
<li>EVENTS ARE OBJECTS</li>
<li>HUMAN BODIES ARE CONTAINERS – She put the wrong things in her body.
I could feel my emotions welling up inside.</li>
<li>IDEAS ARE COMMODITIES
<ul>
<li>IDEAS ARE RESOURCES</li>
<li>IDEAS ARE MONEY</li>
</ul></li>
<li>IDEAS ARE FOOD – He went to college, hungry for knowledge.</li>
<li>IDEAS ARE OBJECTS – He tried to tell me about it last week, but I
rejected the idea.</li>
<li>IDEAS ARE PLANTS – They can be planted. They grow from seeds. We can
water them.</li>
<li>IDEAS ARE PRODUCTS</li>
<li>LIFE IS A CONTAINER</li>
<li>LIFE IS A GAMBLING GAME</li>
<li>LINGUISTIC EXPRESSIONS ARE CONTAINERS</li>
<li>OBJECT EMERGES FROM SUBSTANCE – She made a dish out of clay.</li>
<li>RATIONAL ARGUMENT IS WAR – She attacked his position. I found my
position hard to defend. At that point, my adversary was on the
defensive.</li>
<li>STATES ARE CONTAINERS – He was lost in thought.</li>
<li>SUBSTANCE GOES INTO OBJECT – A lot of iron went into the Eiffel
Tower.</li>
<li>SUBSTANCE IS A CONTAINER – He sculpted David in marble.</li>
<li>THEORIES ARE BUILDINGS – Her theory was built on shaky foundations.
We start with the basics and build upon them until we have built the
entire theory.</li>
<li>TIME IS A MOVING OBJECT – The time will come. Next week is almost

<ul>
<li>Cultivate a playful attitude; laugh.</li>
<li>Structure sufficiently to avoid chaos (entropy).</li>
<li>Eat meals together when possible.</li>
<li>Worry together – “No one should have to worry alone.”</li>

<h1 id="benefit-from-the-lessons-of-act">Benefit from the lessons of
ACT</h1>
<p>ACT means Acceptance and Commitment Therapy.</p>
<p>Don’t struggle with thoughts and feelings. Accept them and take
committed action instead. To cultivate psychological flexibility, be
present, open up, and do what matters. To be present, connect with the
present moment and the knowing self. To open up, accept and unhook. To
do what matters, identify values and take committed action.</p>
<h1 id="be-pragmatic">Be pragmatic</h1>
<p>Consider what effects (which might have practical bearings) we
conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of
those effects is the whole of our conception of the object.</p>
<h1 id="value-things-according-to-formal-axiology">Value things
according to formal axiology</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>“Value is the degree in which a thing fulfills the attributes
contained in the intention of its concept.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Formal Axiology is also called the “Science of Value.”</p>
<h1 id="use-reason">Use reason</h1>
<p>Know what reason is. Know what its rules are. Use them to benefit you
in your goal-seeking behavior.</p>
<p>The basis of reason is the idea that one claim follows from others.
Deduction is reasoning from population to sample. It is deterministic
Induction is reasoning from sample to population. It is probabilistic.
Deduction is to reasoning as induction is to reasons.</p>
<p>Do not solely rely on reason. Richness of life demands more than cold
reason. Reason seldom excites the emotion. Yet the human is an emotional
creature. Be Kirk, not Spock.</p>
<h1 id="use-cost-benefit-model-to-decide">Use cost-benefit model to
decide</h1>
<p>You make many decisions. Some are easy: to take a shower or not. Some
are difficult: to go to college or not. A cost-benefit analysis is a way
to make rational decisions that <a href="#use-reason">Use
reason</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>How do you do it?</em></strong></p>
<p>When you decide between options, consider the costs and the benefits.
Weigh the costs. Weigh the benefits. If the scale is not tipped in favor
of benefits, select something else (if you can). Be honest about the
tradeoffs.</p>
<p>When writing a proposal, benefit-cost ratio equals potential dollars
received times probability of success divided by hours of proposal
writing. Or, mathematically:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$ \text{Benefit-cost ratio} = \frac{P(b)

<p>STOP AT TENSION PRINCIPLE<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> – Play at all times with
relaxed muscles. Stop at the slightest feeling of tension. Control
begins with muscular relaxation. Strive to stay completely relaxed from
the neck, through the shoulders and arms, all the way down to the
fingers</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>START WITH YOUR GRIP PRINCIPLE – The first thing you must do to be a
drummer is grip the stick in the right way. See the 5 Basics video by
Mike Michalkow.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>PLAY FROM THE WRISTS PRINCIPLE - The wrists are the motor. Play from
the wrists, not the elbows. You use less energy that way. Do as little
work as possible. That way you will never tire out.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>RUDIMENTS FIRST PRINCIPLE<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> – Start each session
with rudiments. Rudiments are the key to everything else. Without a
solid handle on rudiments, the rest of your practice will be shaky.
Rudiments are the bedrock upon which you build your foundations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>TWENTY TIMES PRINCIPLE<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> – When practicing rudiments,
practice 20 times without stopping.</p>

<p>METRONOME PRINCIPLE – A metronome keeps you honest. Practice with a
metronome at different speeds, varying from extremely slowly to top
speed, then back down to regular tempo again.</p>

<h1 id="warm-up-before-practicing-drums">Warm up before practicing
drums</h1>
<p>This is a 5-minute warmup.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Shake to loosen your joints.</strong> Shake out your wrists
for 15 to 30 seconds. Link your hands together and rotate your wrists,
10 rounds in each direction. Repeat these for 3 rounds.</li>
<li><strong>Pull hands back – two ways.</strong> Hold up your right arm
with your palm facing away from you. Using your left hand, pull your
palm towards you, make sure your elbow is extended and hold for 5
seconds. You should feel a stretch along your lower forearm. Next,
rotate your right hand down with the palm facing you. Again, pull your
palm towards you, hold for 5 seconds. You should feel a stretch along
your upper forearm. Repeat for your left hand. Then, repeat this
exercise 3 times.</li>
<li><strong>Make fists and stretch out your hands.</strong> With your
hands in front of you, clench for fists tightly for 3 seconds. Then open
your hands as widely as you can without moving your wrists and hold them
there for 3 seconds. Repeat this exercise 3 times.</li>
<li><strong>Grip the stick properly.</strong> Grip the drumstick at the
first knuckle of the index finger at the spot on the stick where it
bounces the most when dropping from horizontal.</li>
<li><strong>Strive to stay completely relaxed.</strong> For the rest of
the session, strive to stay completely relaxed from the neck, through
the shoulders and arms, all the way down to the fingers.</li>
<li><strong>Play single-stroke rolls.</strong> Play medium single-stroke
roll for 1 minute. Start with sticks at 45 degrees to the drum. Pay
special attention to the tips. Make sure they rise to the same line
every time. Start slow, gradually increase tempo. At the 30-mark, start
slowing down again.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Play double-stroke rolls.</strong> Play rebounding double
strokes for 2 minutes. Check grip by dropping a stick to get only one
extra bounce.</li>
<li><strong>Play single-stroke to double-stroke rolls.</strong> Play
single stroke roll to double stroke roll for 2 minutes. Alternate
between <code>LRLR..</code> eighth notes and <code>LLRRLLRR...</code>
sixteenth notes.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="master-single-stroke-rolls">Master single stroke rolls</h1>

<p>Time does not always have to be “managed.” Let’s get that straight
first. But if you find it <em>helpful</em> or <em>useful</em> to do
something to manager your time, you can use some of these tips. The
first batch is from an article called “Crux of Time Management for
Students” by Felix Bast.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Spend time on the right things<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>. Do not spend time on
the meandering things that come.</li>
<li>Use the Eisenhower Matrix to filter candidate activities.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="work-in-10-minute-chunks">Work in 10-minute chunks</h1>
<p>You want to practice things. You want to do productive things. You
sometimes avoid and evade, because you dread the time, effort, and
energy you will spend. By working things in defined, 10-minute bursts,
you will lose that resistance. You will also be very productive. Event
hough 10 minutes sounds short, it adds up if you do it daily.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>10 MINUTES DAILY IS 60 HOURS YEARLY</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let our daily benchmark be <strong>10 minutes per day</strong>.
Assuming you do not skip more than 2% of the days in the year (6 days),
this equates to <strong>60 hours per year</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>What about effort per workday instead?</em></strong></p>
<p>First determine how many work days per year you actually go to work.
At 5 days per week and 52 weeks per year, there are 260 potential work
days per year. We have about 12 holidays which reduces the number to 248
days. My vacation is approximately 4 weeks or 20 days. The final number
for planning is 228 days. Assuming again we do not miss more than 2% (4
days), we will do the activity 224 times in the year. Then <strong>10
minutes per work day</strong> equates to <strong>37 hours per
year</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>10 minutes per work day sums to 37 hours per calendar year.</p>
<p>It is now easy to scale these up and down to other times.</p>

<p><em>What are some productive habits?</em></p>

<li>Practice</li>
<li>Reflection</li>
<li>Rest</li>

<p><em>What does “cultivate” even mean here?</em></p>
<p>The word cultivate is used here because we can understand habits
using the metaphor: HABITS ARE PLANTS. What does this tell us about
habits? They can be nurtured. They need to be cared for to grow and
blossom.</p>
<p><em>How do we cultivate habits?</em></p>
<p>Use mindfulness practice. Focus attention on the small details. Do
not say derogatory things about them. Say positive things like, “I love
the feeling after I exercise.” Consider making a daily routine. Add
Apple Reminders. Add alarms.</p>

<h1 id="use-time-blocking">Use time-blocking</h1>
<p>The calendar can be a powerful tool. Time-block tasks. This prevents
other things from encroaching on them. It gives you the permission to
set aside all other things during that time. Once complete you will
likely feel a sense of accomplishment – a great feeling. You can forgive
yourself for not continuing to work on the task after the timer goes off
and you can stop.</p>
<p><strong><em>Follow these steps to use
time-blocking:</em></strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Trigger</strong>: Deciding to commit to a task.</li>
<li>Estimate the time and energy needed.</li>
<li>Look for spots on your calendar where you expect to have both the
time and energy.</li>
<li>Add a calendar appointment.</li>
<li>On the appointed day, at the appointed time, do the task.</li>
<li>If the task is incomplete at the end, repeat the process – that is,
if you are still committed to completing the job.</li>
<li>If the task is complete, celebrate!</li>

<li>Why am I writing to them? What outcome am I seeking? What is the

<p>Write to communicate effectively – that is to have the effects you
want on your readers. Make writing clear. That is the first priority.
Know what your reader cares about. Give it to them as quickly as you can
and then support it after that.</p>
<p>Follow Bryan A. Garner’s steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Brainstorm</strong>: Think up and <em>write down</em> points
to make.</li>
<li><strong>Outline</strong>: Use the Minto Pyramid Principle to create
an outline.</li>
<li><strong>Write</strong>: Write a draft as fast as you can without
stopping. “Lock up the Judge and write in a headlong rush.”</li>
<li><strong>Wait</strong>: Set it aside for a few minutes or even
days.</li>
<li><strong>Revise</strong>: Fix the overall structure. Move things
around. Alternate with editing.</li>
<li><strong>Edit</strong>: Polish the language. Alternate with
revising.</li>
</ol>
<p>Read your writing out loud. If it does not sound good when read
aloud, revise it. Edit it. Re-read it after that and repeat. Use short
words and short sentences. Eliminate unnecessary words.</p>

<p>“A sentence should have no unnecessary words just as a machine should
have no unnecessary parts.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Use the principle of BLUF – bottom line up front. In an email, this
means opening the email with the punchline. You might have one courtesy
sentence, but then get to the point.</p>
<p>When you write an email, your first line should answer this question
your reader will have: “Why did you write me an email (or a letter)?”
You need to prove to the reader in the first one or two sentences what
you offer them.</p>
<p>Only <em>after</em> BLUF do you explain your reasoning. Normally we
build up from details through our logic and then reach our conclusion.
We work from detailed to general. But when we <em>write</em> about that
process, we follow the opposite path. We start with the conclusion, then
we explain why we believe it, going from general to detailed.</p>
<p>Accept imperfection in your writing. Avoid perfectionism. As Wankat
and Oreovicz (1993) say, “Manuscripts can be revised forever, and the
reader will never think they are perfect.”</p>

<p><strong><em>What is the advice?</em></strong></p>
<p>To write like Barbara Minto’s framework suggests, write from general
to specific. Start with the most general thing you know about the
subject. Make a statement about it – your primary claim. After that,
support each claim with additional claims. You can go several levels
deep this way, as needed.</p>
<p><strong><em>How will the advice help me?</em></strong></p>
<p>You will write better. You will communicate more effectively, because
you are using the natural abilities of the human mind. Your readers will
understand it best when it is presented as Barbara Minto suggested:</p>
<p><strong><em>Why should I believe the advice?</em></strong></p>
<h1 id="use-the-minto-pyramid-principle">Use the Minto Pyramid
Principle</h1>
<p>This is a way to <a href="#write-like-a-pro">Write like a

<p><strong><em>What is the advice?</em></strong></p>
<p>When you write a paper of any kind, use this form:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Each level is a summary of the level below.</li>
<li>Each level contains the same <em>kinds</em> of things.</li>
<li>Each level is <em>logically ordered</em> (induction, deduction,
analogy, parts of a whole,metaphor, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><em>How will the advice help me?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Why should I believe the advice?</em></strong></p>
<h1 id="check-your-references">Check your references</h1>
<p>Check any references you make so you do not discredit yourself with
erroneous references. This agrees with <a

<h1 id="externalize-your-memory">Externalize your memory</h1>
<p>Use externalization but don’t over-use it. Work on your memory too,
strengthening it by testing it. Write down things that are worth the
effort. If the benefit of writing something down outweighs the cost of
recording and later retrieval, then do it.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> On January 25, 2024, you used a Post-It
note on the bathroom mirror to remind you to take the CR-V to work in
the morning.</p>
<figure>

<h1 id="putt-better-by-not-worrying-if-you-will-sink-it">Putt better by
not worrying if you will sink it</h1>
<p>When you worry about how an action is going to work out, you tense
up. This reduces your chances of the action having the desired result.
In another case of irony, the more you worry about failing, the more
likely you are to fail. Being carefree leads to better success.</p>
<h1 id="know-the-adhd-2.0-metaphor">Know the ADHD 2.0 metaphor</h1>
<p>Remember the <em>ADHD 2.0</em> metaphor when dealing with people who
have ADHD, including Julie (self-diagnosed). Here is the metaphor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Race car brain, bicycle brakes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A race car has great power. It can speed off in any direction. It is
quick. It seems to go in short bursts. It is always revving, trying to
bolt. A bicycle is meant for slow speeds. It can only stop a lightweight
vehicle: a bicycle. The person with ADHD has a quick and powerful brain
that they cannot keep from lurching forward, because they have bad
brakes. One way to help them is to help them learn to strengthen their
brakes, if they want to.</p>
<h1 id="treat-others-the-way-they-want-to-be-treated">Treat others the
way they want to be treated</h1>
<p>This is sometimes called <strong>The Platinum Rule</strong> to
differentiate it from the Golden Rule.</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid shaming people.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="never-worry-alone">Never worry alone</h1>
<p>Tell your wife, your son, your friend, a coworker, even a stranger
about your worries.</p>
<h1 id="put-the-tools-away">Put the tools away</h1>
<p>Remember your own saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The job is not done until the tools are put away.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word <em>tool</em> here is meant to be generic. It can stand for
things like files, computers, your phone – in short, anything you use to
complete a task. <strong>Example:</strong> On January 27, 2024, I was
working with both my tickler file and desk file. When I was done
processing papers, I recalled my saying. I said to myself, “the job is
not done until the tools are put away,” and I followed up by putting the
tickler file in my work backpack and the desk file on the shelf above my
desk.</p>
<h1 id="be-mindful-of-thoughts">Be mindful of thoughts</h1>
<p>Be mindful of thoughts. Use mental noting. Use a very soft voice in
your head when mental noting. Mental noting is thought, that’s true. But
it has a different character. Do not start off on a train of thought
while meditating. Even if it is a good idea, let it go. Come back to the
body.</p>
<h1 id="use-the-main-rebt-process">Use the main REBT process</h1>
<p>Ask yourself these four questions in sequence:</p>
<div class="line-block">“How am I disfunctionally feeling or
acting?”<br />
“What are my IBs?”<br />
“How can I challenge my IBs?”<br />
“What realistic preferences can I substitute for my IBs?”</div>
<p><strong><em>What are some examples of IBs?</em></strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I <em>have to</em> do well.</li>
<li>You <em>have to</em> treat me well.</li>
<li>Life <em>has to</em> be fair.</li>
<li>It is horrible to be rejected.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><em>What are some examples of realistic
preferences?</em></strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>While I would <em>like</em> to do well, I do not <em>have to</em> do
well. It is normal and okay to make mistakes and fail sometimes. Such
circumstances are opportunities for learning and growth.</li>
<li>I prefer you treat me the way I want to be treated, but you are a
free human being who can do as you please. I can handle it if you
mistreat me.</li>
<li>Life is often fair but not always. I can cope with unfair
situations, though I may never like them.</li>
<li>I have been rejected many times in the past, and I will be rejected
again. It does not make me a worthless reject. It makes me a human.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="notice-disown-abide">Notice, disown, abide</h1>

<h1 id="become-a-good-leader">Become a good leader</h1>
<p>Genuine leadership starts with a vision – a <em>dream</em> – of what
the leaders system can become.</p>
<p>Good leaders give feedback at the right time: not to quickly and not
too slowly.</p>
<h1 id="zoom-out-to-scroll-faster">Zoom out to scroll faster</h1>
<p>You can scroll faster if you zoom out. Try it in a PDF for example.
Use the mouse wheel to zoom out and then use the mouse to scroll. Zoom
in once you get where you are going. Remember the phrase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Zoom out to scroll faster.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="survey-before-reading">Survey before reading</h1>
<p>Read the chapter headings. Read the abstract. What is this book
about? How is it broken into parts? What does each part cover?</p>
<p>Is there an index? Skim the index.</p>
<p>Look for these overviews and read them (in order of general
preferability:</p>

<h1 id="teach-like-wankat-and-oreovicz-say">Teach like Wankat and
Oreovicz say</h1>
<p>You demonstrate <em>intellectual excitement</em> about the subject.
You are enthusiastic about it. It can be a little silly even. Build
rapport with the students. However, increasing intellectual excitement
is more important.</p>
<ul>
<li>Guide the learner</li>
<li>Develop a structured hierarchy of content</li>
<li>Use images and visual learning</li>
<li>Ensure the student is active</li>
<li>Require practice</li>

<li>Care about what you are doing</li>
<li>If possible, separate teaching from evaluation</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="suspend-needless-anki-cards">Suspend needless Anki cards</h1>
<p>As you do your Anki cards, suspend the note if the answer to the
question, “Would I bet I will use this within one calendar year?” is
“No”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rule: Suspend any Anki card if you would bet <em>against</em> using
it within one calendar year.</p>

<h1 id="reward-yourself-for-being-efficient">Reward yourself for being
efficient</h1>
<p>Wankat (1993) said, “People need a reward for being efficient.”
Reward yourself. Get yourself a cup of coffee or take a break.
Congratulate yourself for working efficiently. Bask in it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write “smell the roses” on your to-do list.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="to-work-efficiently-manage-interruptions">To work efficiently,
manage interruptions</h1>
<p>Go and hide from people. Work off-hours. Work when people take
vacation. Then you can work efficiently with minimal interruptions.</p>
<h1 id="be-action-oriented">Be action-oriented</h1>
<p>Take action. Action is where it is at. Over-analyzing is called
<em>analysis paralysis</em>. Watch for it. Go out and <em>do</em>
something, but make it something helpful, functional, wholesome. This is
Covey’s first habit – “be proactive.” It could be re-written, “be
pro-action.”</p>
