# List of Pages

This is the main page of my website. Welcome!

I have this weird desire to systematize whatever I can. It's like a powerful impulse of mine. This website is my attempt to write a systematic presentation of my worldview. This will allow me to evolve and improve it over time. I can fine-tune it by fine-tuning pages here. As I learn something new, I revise something old. As I make a connection, I make the connection apparent. I spell out the connection. I want to develop a great worldview, adopt that worldview, and prosper even more than I am now, which is a lot I must say. I am really, really prospering in life today.

What on Earth is a "great" worldview? Maybe it is the worldview the adopting of which maximizes the outcome given your current situation. If you find yourself in situation $X$, having a great worldview will help you defend or make gains. 

OK, so I'm trying to develop a great worldview. I fear luck has more to do with happiness than anything else. Maybe even everything is luck. More on that some other time.

I am one lucky man. I am so, damn, lucky. So maybe writing a website is meaningless, because my happiness is just luck. I doubt that. I think having this set of beliefs makes life more difficult and having that set of beliefs makes life easier. The more of those beliefs that make life easier the better. I believe that is the rational conclusion to draw. 

But if it is meaningless, no worries. Writing it gives me something to do. I just learned Kurt Vonnegut said something like, "We are here on Earth to fart around." My fantasy is that something here will help other people, maybe dare I dream _many_ other people. Wouldn't that be cool? That would be cool. Even if that never happens, it was fun making it. Anyway, here are the pages I have so far:

- [Background](background.html)
- [Music](music.html)
- [Setup](setup.html)
- [Writing](writing.html)
- [Your Perfect Right](your-perfect-right.html)
