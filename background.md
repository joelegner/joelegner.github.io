If you read this page, you will know a little more about me that might add context -- might add color -- to the other pages. You don't have to read it. It's okay to navigate back to the index. Here, I will even include a convenient link for that purpose. Bye-bye. It's okay.

OK. That person's gone. Let's get back to it. The headings on this page summarize the points made on the page. I think this might be a good way to write. The top of the page summarizes the headings. The headings each summarize the text below them. Bada-bing, we have a strong and flexible structure. This is probably what Barbara Minto was on about. 

Let's try out our first heading together:

# You can learn something about me by studying this list of roles I play in life.

See? I even made it a complete sentence with a period at the end. Snaz. 

I have this thing about thinking in terms of roles in life. It seems helpful. We humans understand roles. It must be baked into the brain along with other things like a sense of fairness. Each one of these words connotes an infinity of properties about me. Think about it. Being a human being means I have a body, a heart, a mind, skin, a pancreas, a slight tingling in my left foot right now, and a desire to screw, occasionally. OK more than occasionally. But back to the meaning of roles. Think of how long you could go on riffing like this once you know I am a human, a brother, a citizen. Anyway, here is the list for you to ponder:

- Human being
- Student
- Husband
- Father 
- Son
- Brother
- Friend
- Cousin
- Family member
- Teacher
- Engineer
- Manager
- Musician
- Neighbor
- Citizen

Think about it this way: when you find out "Joe is $X$" from this list, how much new information can you assume about Joe? Plug in "manager" for $X$. Knowing I'm a manager, now you can probably make some assumptions. You can update your beliefs about me. Where you might have been ambivalent to my age before knowing I am a manager, you can now probably safely assume I have reached some age of maturity. I am probably old or at least _older_. 

There are reasons for believing this. Usually someone has to work at a place for quite some time before they will consider making you a manager. It is a bit of an honor to be made a manager. So we can at least move the needle toward older -- we know they have "experience" if they are a manager.

Knowing I'm an engineer probably evokes some ideas about what I must be like. You'll be happy to know I'm the coolest kind of engineer of all, the _structural_ engineer. Now you know a _great deal_ more about me, such as that I am awesome.

Now please re-read my list, think about everything you know about the role I named, and I reckon you will know me as well as a stranger could on such short notice. A stranger? A stranger is someone who does not know me "personally". If you know me personally, you know me as a specific person: that one, particular human being in the world. Joe. I am a person to you. If I am not a person to you, say I am simply a name -- Joe -- someone read on the Internet, you only know one role, that of "blogger". Hear me, world -- I am MORE than just a blogger! I am also a musician which is usually way more soul-filling. 

You also should know that I have this desire to try to exhibit the most characteristics of each of those roles as I can with my abilities and circumstances. I want to maximize for personification of those ideals. There is a big and interesting subject called "axiology", and I want to go deep into the weeds on it.

# Knowing my schooling will help you understand me better.

- Pontiac Township High School, 1991.
- Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1995. I am most proud of this one.
- Master of Structural Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa Florida, 2019.
