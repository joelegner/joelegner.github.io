# Roles in Life

I have this thing about thinking in terms of roles in life. It seems helpful. We humans understand roles. It must be baked into the brain along with other things like a sense of fairness. Each one of these words connotes an infinity of properties about me. Think about it. Being a human being means I have a body, a heart, a mind, skin, a pancreas, a slight tingling in my left foot right now, and a desire to screw, occasionally. OK more than occasionally. But back to the meaning of roles. Think of how long you could go on riffing like this once you know I am a human, a brother, a citizen. 

- Human being
- Student
- Husband
- Father 
- Son
- Brother
- Friend
- Cousin
- Family member
- Teacher
- Engineer
- Manager
- Musician
- Neighbor
- Citizen

Think about it this way: when you find out "Joe is $X$" from this list, how much new information can you assume about Joe? Plug in "manager" for $X$. Knowing I'm a manager, now you can probably make some assumptions. You can update your beliefs about me. Where you might have been ambivalent to my age before knowing I am a manager, you can now probably safely assume I have reached some age of maturity. I am probably old or at least _older_. 

There are reasons for believing this. Usually someone has to work at a place for quite some time before they will consider making you a manager. It is a bit of an honor to be made a manager. So we can at least move the needle toward older -- we know they have "experience" if they are a manager.

Knowing I'm an engineer probably evokes some ideas about what I must be like. You'll be happy to know I'm the coolest kind of engineer of all, the _structural_ engineer. Now you know a _great deal_ more about me, such as I am _awesome_. 

Now re-read my list, think about everything you know about the role I named, and I reckon you will know me as well as a stranger could on such short notice.
