    <h1 id="metaphor">Metaphor</h1>
    <p>Metaphor pervades English, even this very sentence. The reason is
    straightforward. To understand anything new is to understand it in
    terms of things you already know. From this principle comes
    metaphor.</p>
    <p>What is metaphor?</p>
    <p>We will try to answer this question by analyzing a few examples.
    Consider this English sentence:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>I’m running out of time.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This is a metaphor. Do you see the metaphor? We understand it
    because we understand what it means to run out of something in the
    physical world. It means consuming things until the quantity become
    low. Here in the sentence “I’m running out of time” is the metaphor
    TIME IS A RESOURCE.</p>
    <p>What is time?</p>
    <p>Time is difficult to define. A simple definition might be, “That
    which is measured by a clock.” I think Einstein said something like
    this. It is not a bad definition, becasue it helps you understand
    Einstein’s Theory of Relativity for example. But when we say we are
    “running out of time” we are not thinking of time in this way. We
    are thinking of it as if it is a finite resource. If you are fishing
    and hook a big fish, and it runs away from you, you might say, “I am
    running out of line.” The line is one kind of resource. To run out
    of the line, then, is to be deprived of possessing it due to
    consumation.</p>
    <p>What is consumation?</p>
    <p>Consumation is a word we use for eating. When we say we have
    consumed all our fishing line, we understand it as if the line were
    eaten. If we had grapes and consumed them all, they would be gone
    forever. We get this at a basic level, the level of a toddler. Eat
    the last of the M&amp;Ms and see how the toddler reacts. So our
    explanation of TIME IS A RESOURCE needs to go into what it is to be
    a reasource, and in doing so we introduce a new metaphor:
    CONSUMATION IS EATING. It is necessary to the story, because it is
    how we explain that a resource is something used up. Once we get to
    eating, we stop, because our most primitive toddler self knows that
    one already.</p>
    <p>This seems to be how English works.</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li>Higher level concepts are constructed from lower level.</li>
    <li>At the bottom level are the basic concepts a toddler
    understands. They are always things in the real, physical
    world.</li>
    </ol>
