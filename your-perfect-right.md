I am reading a book called _Your Perfect Right_, Tenth Edition, by Robert Alberti, PhD and Michael Emmons, PhD. It is about improving your life through skill-building, especially assertiveness training. It is essentially a manifesto about why you should be assertive in life rather than the polar opposites of aggressive and passive. It is truly a "middle way" between aggressiveness and passivity. 

Since they are polar opposite, they slope away from each other. Whatever outcomes are produced by aggressiveness decline the closer you get to passivity. 

Being at the middle, you have none of the aggressive behavior outcomes and none of the passive behavior outcomes. How so? What other category of outcome is there beyond these two? 

I say it is _rational_ outcomes. I say it is outcomes resulting from the best use of reason you can muster. It is the outcomes you get when you follow your reason as far as she will take you. 

Aggression is okay when it is rational to be aggressive. Say you rationally assess a situation and judge that a little aggressiveness might scare off a would-be mugger. Would it not be rational to be a little aggressive? You're just playing the odds. You are betting that you will have a better outcome if you _choose_ to be aggressive.

Maybe anger is when you are aggressive, but it is not your choice. You could not retroactively explain why it made sense to be aggressive in that scenario, unlike the purly-rational mugger scaring stunt. Irrational anger is a problem. Rational anger is assertiveness. Assertiveness is rational anger.

Passiveness is okay when it is rational to be passive. Suppose you are waiting for a hotel desk clerk to check you in. It is rational to be passive and wait idle while the clerk does their work. (Ooh, the clerk does work -- clerk work). It is polite. It will garner better cooperation from the other person. The transaction will go more smoothly if both parties respect each other. Reciprocal respect is the order of the day. And often it is necessary to be a little passive, but not overly passive, in support of larger goals, like not getting thrown out of a hotel.

Anyway, the book offers more and better analysis than this, so let's get to it. 

# The Goals

The goals of this strange experiment include:

> See if I retain information better when I actively summarize. This is the hypethesis.

What would it look like if I was successful? I would be able to read my summary and immediately bring to mind the entire work. That would be a huge success. More likely at least remember the over-arching message and themes of the book. The essence would be okay. 

It could also result in a failed experiment if the added cost of writing the summary was not worth the added benefit to learning. 

# Method of Authorship

Each time I read the book, I will spend 15-25 minutes reading and simultaneously writing this summary. I will get the book, open this VS Code session, and begin to type after the first paragraph. 

The goal is to summarize the book. Here are some ideas:

- Read the entire passage, then summarize it, returning to the text as-needed.
- Read the passage and summarize it at the same time.
    - Summarize each paragraph with one complete sentence, then add some filler in between them as-needed to make it flow. 
    - Summarize as the spirit moves you. This is probably the better way.

# Summary to Date

TODO: Start here on Saturday, August 5, or whenever the spirit moves you to do it later, or never.
