This is a pretty good list of things I value. When I use the word _value_ here, I mean desired quality of ongoing action. Values are not goals. They involve continuous behavior. Being loved is not a value. It is a goal. You can check it off your list when it happens. _Kindness_ is a value. You can never check it off the list. You can behave _with_ kindness. Kindness is a quality of action, so in my system it can be called a value. Here are the rest:

Each value is an “ongoing action” that cannot be completed. 

Each value is declared, not discovered. 

Each value is global to me and my life as a whole. Don’t make it too specific. 

The values are listed alphabetically, not ranked by importance. Importance of values changes with situation. Situation can be thought of as a snapshot of facts at a moment. 

Each value includes a quality, which is a value judgment about it.
