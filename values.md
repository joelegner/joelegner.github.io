I want to share my values. That way you will understand better where I am coming from and where I am trying to head. But to understand the list, you will need to understand how I use the word value. 

I am using "value" to mean "any desirable quality of ongoing action." This is from ACT -- Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. It is my interpretation of ACT's definition. 

It is easy to mistake values for goals. Values are not the same thing as goals. They involve _continuous_ behavior. A goal can be checked off. No value can be checked off. A goal can be achieved. No value cannot be achieved. A goal is a concrete result. A value is an abstract quality of something else -- my behavior. 

And what is behavior? Behavior includes anything that I do that can be seen or heard doing. Behavior is overt. Behavior is public. If I was being filmed, the film camera and microphones would capture my behavior. It would not capture my thoughts, even if I said them out loud. Saying them is behavior. Thoughts are covert. Thoughts are private.

Let's see a contrast. _Being loved_ is not a value. It is a goal. You can check it off your list when it happens. On the other hand, _kindness_ is a value. You can never check it off the list. You can behave _with_ kindness. 

Kindness, on the other hand, is a quality of action. So in my system it can be called a value. 

Now that you understand how I am using words like value, goal, and behavior, here comes the list. As you read each one, you can choose to prefix the affirmational phrase, "_May I act with the quality of..._"
