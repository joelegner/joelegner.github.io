</header>
<p>Meditations of Joe Legner #Philosopher Not to be outdone by the
genius of Marcus Aurelius (let’s just call him Marcus) in his eerily
similar-sounding work entitled “Meditations of Marcus Auralias” I am now
writing my own take on it.</p>
<p>Why not? I am pretty smart. I am pretty wise. I am definitely
confident. Let’s see what mine look like.</p>
<p>What are the rules?</p>
<p>Rule #1: The target audience is Joseph Michael Legner,
Sr. (“Joe”).</p>
<p>Rule #2: No entry shall knowingly contradict another entry, a
commonly believed fact, a law of nature, a rule of logic.</p>
<p>Rule #3: It has to be typed out. It is in written format.</p>
<p>Right now it’s in Apple Notes, but it need not stay there.</p>
<p>Repetition is okay. It is okay to go back over the same ground. Turn
the thing around and look at it from different angles. Make it one list
of numbered thoughts.</p>
<p>Each thought could be a sentence, a paragraph, or a few paragraphs.
Probably more than two screenfuls should be plenty. Anything more than
that — break it down further.</p>
<p>We may name principles along the way. That way we can refer to them
later.</p>
<p>The list is partially chronological. I will always add to it. I might
publish a snapshot or post the thing online.</p>
<p>The idea or goal is to be helpful.</p>
<p>The audience is me. I hope others will read it. But when I say “you”
in a thought, I am talking to myself. The writer me addresses the reader
me.</p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Let your PURPOSE be to use this life you were given to the best of
your abilities to help yourself, your family, and your world.</li>
<li>LIVE LIFE. BE OR DO. GROW.</li>
<li>MEDITATIONS PURPOSE. Why write down thoughts, ideas, musings? To
help people. To help you. To help clarify and refine the ideas. To
transfer wisdom. You value being helpful, right? Writing these notes
helps you be more helpful — by reading, revisiting, editing, and using
these meditations.</li>
<li>RULE OF NON-CONTRADICTION. Do not knowingly contradict yourself
within this document. Do not contradict a law of nature or matter of
fact. It is okay to be mistaken and change it later. You may write about
how you’ve never seen a black swan and then see one. After that
sighting, you ought to change the note to match the new reality.</li>
<li>LOVE ABOVE ALL ELSE. A human life is so short. And there is nothing
new under the sun. You will surely die and just as surely be forgotten.
Even were the entire world to know me, someday no one will know me.
Someday there will be nobody left. And what good does posthumous fame do
you anyway? Accepting all this, why not be kind, do the right things,
and love everyone you can. Love yourself. Love your wife. Love your
kids. Love your neighbors. Love your friends. Care about them and care
for them. Try to be kind and patient always. If you read no further this
advice is sufficient to satisfy the author.</li>
<li>BE PRESENT. Connect with the present moment. Feel the air. What’s it
feel like? Feel the surface supporting you. Is it hard? Soft? Does it
move? See. Smell. Examine. Also connect with the knowing self.</li>
<li>PURSUIT OF VIRTUE. Know what is right, do what is good, and
therefore be happy or tranquil. Epictetus says the product of virtue is
tranquility. You know this from personal experience. When you do what is
bad, your tranquility is disturbed. This is because it is your nature to
get along with other people, not to cheat them, lie to them, deceive
them, take their property, or do anything else antisocial. A human is a
RATIONAL AND SOCIAL ANIMAL.</li>
<li>STUDY THE LANGUAGE. A claim is expressed in natural language. Yours
is English. Your skill at speaking and writing English and comprehending
it verbally and in writing affects the effectiveness of this work. Get
better at wielding English.</li>
<li>SELF-EVIDENCE OF LOGIC. Logic seems to be self-evidently valid. As
soon as you ask “why” you announce that you will accept reasons. Once
you do that you announce you accept reason and logic. But all arguments
(including this one) are based ultimately on unprovable assumptions or
axioms. They are assumed, not obviously true.</li>
<li>LOGICAL VALIDITY. An argument consistently developed according to
the rules of logic is deemed logically valid. Valid means having
sufficient strength or force; founded in truth; capable of being
justified, defended, or supported; not weak or defective; sound; good;
efficacious; as, a valid argument; a valid objection.</li>
<li>IMPLICATION OF LOGICAL VALIDITY. If an argument is logically valid
and the premises are true, then you cannot rationally doubt the
conclusion. This is rare in practice. It may never happen in real life.
Maybe it happens in mathematics. But even in math the humility of
knowing the mathematician is a human and therefore liable to make errors
should give one pause.</li>
<li>ACTIONS ARE GAMBLES. We can never be logically certain that the
conclusion of any logical argument (including this one) is true. It is
only probabilistic. That’s why all our actions are gambles. Certainty is
not a standard you need to worry about. You need to worry about GAMBLES
under uncertainty.</li>
<li>DEFINITION OF GAMBLE(v). To risk something of value on the outcome
of a game of chance. SYNONYMS FOR GAMBLE. Bet and wager are synonyms for
gamble.</li>
<li>DEFINITION OF BELIEF. When you believe something, it means you are
willing to bet on it being true. You are willing to give up something of
value — or potential value — if it turned out to be false. So while it
is mildly interesting to talk about certainty and entertain that it is
impossible, you are better off worrying about whether this or that
belief is something you’re willing to bet on — and how much you would
risk. You bet your life every day that the laws of gravity hold at all
times and in all places. You bet your money, health, and life whenever
you believe, “I can drive from point A to point B and do it safely.” You
cannot prove it. There are far too many factors that you do not control.
But you can bet on it. A trip to the grocery store is a GAMBLE. Getting
a particular college degree is a gamble. Turning the key on the ignition
of your car is a gamble. Asking her to marry you is a gamble. What is
not a gamble?</li>
<li>DEFINITION OF CLAIM. A sentence uttered about the world that bears
truth or falsity when interpreted in a certain spacetime context. A
claim is a sentence that can be judged true or false. SYNONYMS FOR
CLAIM. Argument, statement, proposition.</li>
<li>BASIS OF REASONING. Your reasoning works like this: one claim
follows from other claims. Let’s look at an example. The streets are wet
(claim). When it rains, the rain wets the street (claim). There are no
other known mechanisms to wet all the streets (claim). Therefore it must
have rained (conclusion claim). If the first three claims are judged
true by the interlocutor, the conclusion should be judged true.</li>
<li>PHYSIOLOGICAL NEEDS. A human body needs air. Your human body needs
air. A human body needs water. Your human body needs water. A human body
needs food. Your human body needs food. Treat your body like the finest,
most advanced vehicle on the market, because it is. Your body plan was
encoded over hundreds of millions of years by natural selection.</li>
<li>INNATENESS OF WALKING. The human body is designed to walk. You have
a human body. You have the ability to walk. That ability comes from your
human body — an asset in your service.</li>
<li>INNATENESS OF TALKING. You are a human and so you are designed to
talk. You can use your human body to communicate with another mind using
your two bodies.</li>
<li>READING IS LEARNED. Humans like you are not designed to read and
write. These skills are not innate. People must learn to read and write.
Kids learn to speak effortlessly. They learn to read with effort.</li>
<li>STARTING FACTS. You are a living human being on this planet at this
time in this body under these circumstances.</li>
<li>INEVITABILITY OF DEATH. You will die, but you don’t know when it
will happen.</li>
<li>WORLDLY CONTEXT. You live in a natural world. You are subject to
nature’s rules. We sometimes call them laws, but rules is good enough.
You are a human and so have human nature. You are subject to the rules
of human nature. Expecting anything else will lead to stress and
suffering.</li>
<li>INTENSION OF THE WORD HUMAN. Humans are rational, cooperative,
social animals. They are better off cooperating with others. To not
cooperate is to violate human nature. Stealing is an example. Stealing
harms the thief. The thief is the victim of their own theft. This is
because stealing is selfish and therefore antisocial. To be a thief is
to not be a good human, for a good human cooperates with other humans. A
good human does not defect against others. Anyone who goes against these
things is truly an animal. The thief is an animal insofar as they reject
the prosocial nature of a human being.</li>
<li>PROSOCIAL MANDATE. Do not be antisocial. Be prosocial. This does not
mean you must go along with what society pressures you to do. Only go
along when the motive is wholesome and action is pure and good.
Otherwise reject and attempt to persuade others to do likewise.</li>
<li>VALUE OF SELF KNOWLEDGE. Know human nature. That way you can prepare
yourself for it. Be open minded and curious about your human nature.
What makes you feel better? What makes you feel worse? What feelings
last? Do any last? What happens when you neglect an area of life? What
happens when you over-emphasize? Take a few minutes sometimes and
reflect on questions like these.</li>
<li>AXIOLOGY OF HUMAN NATURE. Human nature is the measuring stick for
your life overall. The more you follow nature the better. This is
related to formal axiology. A human being is good to the degree they
exhibit the properties of a good human being. A good human being is one
that always abides by nature and is kind and helpful to the world.
Nobody has zero goodness. And on the flip side nobody is perfect — that
is, always good. You are tarnished but still look good. Call it
patina.</li>
<li>ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF LOVE. Why love? It feels good. It is
wholesome, so it is rational to want it. It makes you healthier. It
feels good because it is in your nature to love. Human beings love. It
matters. It is a part of human nature. It is probably part of the nature
of all mammals. So when you do something unloving, a little bad feeling
arises. When you do something loving, a good feeling arises. And it
stays. It feels good to be good.</li>
<li>LIFE IS ABOUT ACTION. Live life. It is about doing. It is about
taking concrete action. It is about moving your body and moving objects
with your body. Get out and do things. Get after it. Work and play hard.
Laugh. Cuddle. Mess around with computer programs. Keep learning piano.
Learn key drums. The details will change. The universal recommendation
is to live. Live with love. This is the PRIME DIRECTIVE.</li>
<li>What kind of human behavior do you value? You can complete this
sentence: “I like it when humans XYZ” or “I like it when humans act like
ABC”. Think of values as ongoing qualities of action. Your VALUES are
QUALITIES OF ACTION — YOUR ACTIONS. Those are the only ones you need
worry about.</li>
<li>VALUE ORDER. Value order. Value time spent picking up, organizing,
and sorting.</li>
<li>VALUE FRIENDLINESS. This leads you to value habits like saying hello
to people next to you on planes and trains, offering to help people, and
responding kindly when someone seems frazzled.</li>
<li>VALIE KINDNESS. Value kindness. You want your speech to be kind. You
want your actions to be kind. You want to be kind to yourself, too.</li>
<li>VALUE PATIENCE. Patience is about letting time pass for the benefit
of others. It is about not getting angry when delayed by others. They
are trying to do what they think is right. To you they seem to be going
the wrong way. You think they are going about it wrong. But that’s their
choice. You can be kind. You can be patient.</li>
<li>POLICY OF HONESTY. Be completely honest with yourself. If you’re
being an asshole, say, “I am being an asshole right now. I don’t want to
be one. I would like to try to reset as kind Joe.” This is a form of
mindfulness. It is also a form of integrity. You want to be mindful. You
want to have integrity. That includes being honest with yourself.
Similarly, be as honest and open as you can be with others. Allow
yourself to hold off until the time is right — that is, when you are
ready and the other person is ready. But don’t assume it will get
easy.</li>
<li>KNOW YOUR FEELINGS. Be interested in your feelings. Be honest about
them. How do you feel? Do not judge the feelings. That is key. Try not
to judge is an important recommendation. Just look at things in this
moment at face value.</li>
<li>INESCAPABLE NATURE OF ASSENT. You can only assent to what appears to
be true. That is how your faculty of understanding works. Do not assume
it will ever deviate from this rule. Epictetus explained this well in
his Discourses.</li>
<li>Do what is necessary, even if it is hard. Necessary for what?
Necessary to support the MISSION.</li>
<li>Your MISSION is to use this life you were given, to the best of your
abilities, to help yourself, your family, and the world.</li>
<li>Always know why you are doing what you are doing. Simple test: be
able to answer: “Why are you doing this?” or “Why am I doing this?” Say
the question aloud, sometimes.</li>
<li>The point of life is to live it. Meaning is action. Action is
meaning. An event means something if it gets you to do something. The
death of a family member gets you to do many things: grieve, laugh, cry,
get angry, travel, visit family, take time off work, search your soul,
reevaluate your life. It is meaningful because it trigger many
behaviors. This is a hypothesis.</li>
<li>Live. Do things. Take actual action. Think about the function of
life. In the context of everyday life, to talk about what something does
or how it can be used, use the term function.</li>
<li>Do things. Go do things. Set goals, lofty ones. Seek richness of
life. Try new things. Explore. Keep learning.</li>
<li>Keep studying the ENGLISH LANGUAGE. English is key to your survival
and success. It is how you reason. It is how you communicate. Make sure
you are good at it. Use it wisely, kindly, honorably.</li>
<li>It’s okay to be funny. It’s okay to be irreverent. It’s even
encouraged.</li>
<li>Reread this list from time to time. Edit it. Be bold. Cut things
out. Add things. Change entire structures. Move things around. Split up
notes. Put them together. Have a ball.</li>
<li>As you read and revise this work, seek and destroy contradictions.
What forms of contradiction are there? You say A is X at the same time
you say A is not X. One claim is speaking against the other —
contra-diction.</li>
<li>Language is meant to serve you, to further your interests. It is a
tool to use. When you make contradictions, you sully the good name of
language. Use it as is meant.</li>
<li>You may not want to run anymore. It probably damages your knees,
hips, feet, and back.</li>
<li>People are unhappy when they go against their nature. The nature of
man is to cooperate with others.</li>
<li>You can choose to accept yourself as-is, right this very moment. Try
it! “I accept myself, right now, fully, just as I am.”</li>
<li>Do not desire what is external. Fame is an example. Wealth is
another. Sex too. Something external does not belong to you for others
can deprive you of anything external. They can withhold it. They can
take it away. But who can deprive you of your own will? No one. It is
yours.</li>
<li>One source of your suffering: you want sex, and fail to have sex, or
enough sex, or the right kind of sex. But sex is not under your control.
Your partner (Julie) can deprive you of it. And it’s okay when she does.
It’s okay because it’s exactly what arose in nature. Align your mind
with this interpretation. Understanding this and acting according to the
nature of the situation is in your power.</li>
<li>It is irrational to be sexually frustrated. It serves no purpose. It
does not cultivate the conditions for sex. It struggles against nature.
Nature decides when you have sex. The circumstances arise when they
arise. You can influence some of them, but it’s probabilistic at best.
Accept this. Be content with what you have. It’s as good as possible.
Love her. Love on her. That is enough.</li>
<li>When you desire what is external you make yourself a slave of
others. How so? You must obey others to try to obtain what is external.
If you want sex, you have to obey Julie. If you can take it or leave it,
you are free. The Stoics would congratulate you. They would say to look
inward. But you need not obey anyone except yourself. That is your will.
You can always be free if you do not desire what is outside your heart
and mind.</li>
<li>What does it mean to look inward? Does it mean looking toward
yourself? Maybe looking inwardly is better — not looking inside but
toward the inside.</li>
<li>Imagine the power to grant happiness is an object. That object is
inside you now. That’s the way to contemplate this idea about looking
for happiness inside. Think of it literally as an object. Is that object
your brain? Maybe the metaphor is no metaphor at all. The true power is
in your skull. It is the prefrontal cortex of your human brain.</li>
<li>No entry in this list should cross the boundary to another entry.
Let each stand on its own. They may be connected by the way they talk
about the same ideas. But do not let words connect them directly. Do not
have follow ups. Do not use cross references. Stay in the same entry
until the ideas are fully expressed. Then stop writing. Tap Done.</li>
<li>How does writing in this list make you feel?</li>
<li>Who are you helping by writing this list? In what ways are you
helping them?</li>
<li>Anger is the desire to punish. It is wanting payback. It is wanting
to inflict retribution. The expression of anger is the attempt to
punish. It is the attempt to get payback. It is the infliction of
retribution.</li>
<li>When you desire money, you must obey the people who give you the
money.</li>
<li>When you desire accolades, you must obey the people whose praise you
seek.</li>
<li>Look at yourself at random moments. Are you doing something
wholesome? Carry on. Not? Hmm. Do something else. This is within your
power.</li>
<li>Suicide is always an option. The stoics knew this. They talk about
that always being an open door. You can step out when you want. Right
now you definitely want to stay here. May the door be a comfort not a
terror. The comfort? Should you find yourself in intense pain with not
hope of remittance, there’s the door.</li>
<li>When you desire healthcare, you must obey the people working within
the healthcare system, the insurance people, government officials, and
probably others. You need approvals. You worry about disapproval.</li>
<li>Do not be an APPROVAL JUNKIE. Go to rehab. Approval depends on
others. If it happens, okay. If not, okay.</li>
<li>Do you approve of your behavior? If you do, there is no problem.
Steady as she goes. It is your INTERNAL APPROVAL that matters most.</li>
<li>Notice the ways Buddhism and Stoicism hit on many common theses
among their recommendations for a good and happy life. Both seek peace
within.</li>
<li>The nature of man is to: First, assent to what is believed true.
This is natural. It is how the faculty of understanding is designed to
work. Anything else is unnatural. Put another way, you cannot honestly
assent to what you secretly believe is false. Second, dissent to what is
believed false. This is natural. Anything else is unnatural. You cannot
dissent to what you believe is true. Third, seek the good. This is
natural. Anything else is unnatural. Can it be done? Does good mean
beneficial here? Does good simply mean helpful? Advantageous?
Beneficial?Fourth, avoid the bad. This is natural. Anything else is
unnatural. Does bad mean harmful here? Disadvantages? Unhelpful?Fifth,
collaborate with others. This is natural. Anything else is
unnatural.</li>
<li>These things are not subject to the power of others. They cannot
deprive you of them. They are yours. They are the wellspring of
tranquility: LOVE (mine), will, choices, decisions, agreement,
disagreement, thoughts, behavior (mine), preferences, freedom (release
from desire), aversions (removal of desire), goals, values, loyalty (to
others), just actions, opinions, beliefs, renouncement, vigilance,
mindfulness, being honorable, being noble, being helpful, being kind,
being patient, being useful, tranquility, modesty, constancy,
steadiness, patience, abstinence, cooperation (with others), freedom
from affects, decency, purpose, power (over my own will), avoidance of
unwise things, in a word: liberty.</li>
<li>These things are subject to the power of others. Power means the
ability to make something happen that you want to happen. Power is about
implementing your will. Others can deprive you of some things, things
external to you. Therefore they are not yours. They are nothing to you:
body, health, life, power (over others), being loved (by others), lives
of family, lives of friends, opinions of others, behavior (of others),
blame, ridicule, envy (of others), possessions, wealth, reputation,
loyalty (of others), cooperation (of others), legacy, esteem, rank,
status, being pitied. Let them come and go over the days, weeks, months,
and years.</li>
<li>Some habits prevent tranquility. One habit is concern about what
other people think, say, and do. They are not within your locus of
control. So when you tie your happiness to them, you give them power
over your happiness. And they are over there in their own world. Who
knows why they think the way they do. They probably don’t. Let it go and
do the right thing.</li>
<li>Speculate about what others think at your own peril. They think as
fast and as much as you. It might be enough to know simply that their
mental life is as rich as yours.</li>
<li>You can be brave against the threats of the world while you’re doing
the right thing. While doing the wrong thing, cower in fear. Better to
be brave. Better to do the right thing.</li>
<li>Feel irritated? Count to 10. Still irritated? Count higher.</li>
<li>What’s the next good thing you can do? It can be small. Throw away a
bit of trash. Put away that thing. Text someone.</li>
<li>Decouple yourself from the opinions of others. Their opinions are
based upon different information than you have, their own life history,
different from yours, and how do you even know they are sincere? They
might believe deceiving you is better than not for some irrational
reason. They might even be deceiving themselves! Let them think what
they think. Go do the right things.</li>
<li>Whatever you frequently think about, that will become the
inclination of your mind. This is similar to other ways the brain works,
for example when you are learning a musical instrument, early on you are
supposed to sacrifice timing for perfect notes. You want to train the
brain with very clear and unambiguous signals. If you sometimes hit C
and sometimes hit B, the brain doesn’t know what to do. The rule is
unclear. But if you always hit C — because you sacrificed timing and
even stopped to get the right note — the rule is clear: hit C every
time. The mind gets that better.</li>
<li>USEFULNESS OF PLAY. Playing for fun is useful. You can think of it
that way. Play Angband.</li>
<li>Here’s another OPPORTUNITY TO PRACTICE PATIENCE.</li>
<li>LIFE IS A JOURNEY METAPHOR. You are here for the journey.<br />
</li>
<li>Tonight I collaborated with Julie and Tommy to solve a problem. You
enjoy and benefit from PROBLEM SOLVING.</li>
<li>Follow the PLATINUM RULE when you can: “treat others the way they
want to be treated.” What if you don’t know how they want to be treated?
Ask them if you can. Otherwise you will have to guess. A starting point
is the inferior GOLDEN RULE: “treat others the way you would want to be
treated.”</li>
<li>Julie sometimes seem bossy when she’s passionate. She can seem
impatient too. You do not need to form either of these opinions. Your
opinion ought to remain neutral. Be calm and let her be herself. Show
interest and try to treat her the way she wants to be treated.</li>
<li>HALT METHOD. Tiredness is a big contributing factor to mood and
emotional stability in particular. Watch out when you’re tired. Use HALT
practice with Julie. She will understand it. Say, “I just realized I am
feeling tired, like the T in HALT. I’d like to rest up before we
continue. I think that will improve the outcome.” “I am hungry — the H
in HALT. I want to eat something. Otherwise I am feeling hangry.” She
understands this.</li>
<li>WORK TOWARD GOODNESS NOT PERFECTION. You don’t have to be perfect.
Forget about it. Try to be good — that is to exhibit the traits of the
man you want to become. That is all. Try to be a good man, to discover
what is good, to work toward promoting it. Do this relentlessly.</li>
<li>MONSTER UNDER THE BED. Use this phrase to lampoon popular fears that
have no basis in reality, that are only useful to frighten children.
Obama is secretly Muslim is a monster under the bed. “Hell is real” is a
monster under the bed. The devil is real is a monster under the
bed.</li>
<li>NOBLE EMULATION. VIRTUOUS EMULATION. Settle on one. Think about
someone of old that lived a virtuous life. Emulate them. Look at
Einstein. What about Marcus too? Are there others?</li>
<li>Use ROAD SIGNS. Each all caps term is a road sign. It helps you
quickly navigate to the advice you seek. Let’s try one shall we.</li>
<li>Always keep in mind: EVERYTHING CHANGES. It is the nature of nature
to be always in flux. Nature flows. It is a river of events. Mountains
are pushed up, only to be melted by water and wind. A grape grows,
matures, becomes a raisin, then is no more. A leaf buds, spreads out,
soaks up the sun for a season, withers, falls, is returned to the soil
from where it came. Some of the soil will be a leaf again. Some of it
will be you.</li>
<li>You may be dead in the morning. Live today — right now.</li>
<li>It’s your last night on earth. What will you do? Who will you be
with? Why do that? Why them? What do you feel?</li>
<li>YOUR SHARE OF THE COMMON GOOD. Julie saw ants in the house, wanted
them sprayed. At first you balked a little. “Why not get the pros to
spray?” We hire a service. But you remembered Marcus. Anything you do
that benefits the common good benefits you too! So you got the spray.
Spraying the ants benefitted the household including you. Wisdom that
leads to helpful action is meaningful. You got some from Marcus.<br />
</li>
<li>NO DEGRADING LABELS. Approval and disapproval is for actions, not
people. A person is too complex to receive an overall rating. A person
is many, many things. A person is not one thing. An act may be
condemned. The actor may not. Condemning the actor is an overreach.</li>
<li>BE SKEPTICAL OF YOUR RECOLLECTIONS. “The past is nothing more than
fallible memories and evolving stories.” Remember this. Do not trust
your memory. Use documentary evidence when it’s available. Trust not
your recollections. Trust them more if they agree with the documentary
evidence. Memories encoded in the brain are corrupted by later attempts
to retrieve them. And it’s all stories anyway. Life is infinitely richer
than stories. You make it all into a story to make sense of it. But your
mind, as powerful as a human mind is, is feeble when compared to the
enormity of even one instant of time. So relax. Be okay with not being
sure of what really happened in the past. Instead come back to now,
right now, in this body. It’s more real here than in your head.</li>
<li>SELF INTERVIEW TECHNIQUE. What do you make of that? What does it
mean? Why does it matter? To whom does it matter? What does it do for
you? How is it inconvenient? What effort is needed for it? How will this
affect you? How will this affect your decisions? Ask yourself questions
like this. Record the questions and answers. Play them back and study
them.</li>
<li>DECISION LOG. Record a decision. Then revisit it and try to learn
from it. What do we want to know about a decision? Explain the
situation. What is the challenge you’re facing? Next state what options
you thought up and considered. State the one you chose. Explain why you
chose that one. Was it more likely to succeed? Is it less expensive?
Less risky? More beneficial?</li>
<li>DECISION PROCESS IMPROVEMENT. Listen to old decisions and revisit
them to improve your decision making process.</li>
<li>EMOTIONAL VOICE INSIGHT. “To recognize emotions in others, use your
ears not your eyes.” Humans are adept at wearing a mask to hide
emotions. You cannot trust the face. But they are less in control of the
voice. Agitation can be detected in the voice. Listen for it. See if the
face is masking something below.</li>
<li>IRONY OF KARMA. Irony abounds. Striving for happiness makes one
unhappy. Desiring not to feel X makes the feeling stronger. Pushing away
thoughts increases them. Do not resist. Turn and look directly at the
thing. Let it be there. Let the feeling be there. Abide in it. Notice if
you are secretly chafing against the feeling. Laugh at yourself
then.</li>
<li>CONCEPT: SIX SENSE DOORS. At any instant only six things are
happening to you: seeing, smelling, hearing, tasting, feeling, and
thinking. Only these six. There are no other components to human
experience. Buddhism taught you this.</li>
<li>GUARDING THE SENSE DOORS. This is a process. Try to split the focus
of your attention between all six senses. Can you see, hear, smell,
taste, touch, and think all at the same time and know you are doing each
of them and all of them? It seems possible.</li>
<li>OPEN HEARTED PRESENCE is feels like it sounds. When it is not
present you can ask yourself,“What stands between me and open-hearted
presence?” Tara Brach said this.</li>
<li>LINE-WISE IMPROVEMENT. Each line of code you write makes you a
better programmer. Each problem you solve makes you a better problem
solver. Today you did both while studying Swift. This helps by moving
you closer to your goal of writing a Dueler app. It also sets the stage
so you can write Determine and Axiomat. Celebrate when it happens that
way.</li>
<li>You call a 7-1/2 minute period of time a MINIMUM PROGRESS CHUNK.
There are six chunks in 45 minutes. There are ten in an hour. The beauty
of a chunk is that it is 75% of 10 minutes. And doing something for that
long makes you feel like you accomplished something, moved forward, made
progress. That’s why you call it a MINIMUM PROGRESS CHUNK. (Think of a
better name. What about MPC?)</li>
<li>THREE FUNDAMENTAL STANCES. You can move toward something. You can
move away from it. You can stay the same distance away. There are no
other choices. Forward, backward, or neutral. Perhaps this is our worm
heritage. Our nervous system evolved from a worm’s. Maybe that’s why we
so deeply intuit toward and away from something. Even a worm can feel
that.</li>
<li>THREE BASIC OPINIONS. You can assent to a claim. You can dissent to
a claim. You can suspend judgment (this includes mixed feelings). You
can split up the claim and accept or reject or suspend judgment each of
the new parts independently. There are no other choices. Agree,
disagree, or do neither. You got this idea from Epictetus and added the
previous insight about toward, away, or stay put. This invokes metaphors
we live by.</li>
<li>You desire what is advantageous to you. It is impossible not to want
things that you think are advantageous to you. Advantageous? You want
it. This is probably a hard wired tendency of animals. It is an axiom.
It is a postulate. It is true for you. It is true for other people.
Anything that seems to contradict this is suspect. If you want the other
thing, it means you think the other thing is more advantageous.</li>
<li>Be sane. How? Rule your life with your faculty of reason. Live in
accordance with your personal nature and the nature of the world you
belong to. Belong to the world. Belong with other people. Belong in
nature. You are part of it. It is part of you. Energy and matter flows
between you and the environment. Actually there is no between. There is
energy here and there. The edges are so fuzzy that, for some purposes,
they might as well not exist.</li>
<li>Cultivate a HEALTHY MIND. Why? A healthy mind benefits you and the
world. How? Care for your mental health. Watch out for warning signs of
trouble. Talk to Julie. Talk to therapists if you need to. Do those
things that lead to a healthy mind. Reduce stress. Spend time with other
people. Do what is in your human nature.</li>
<li>Cultivate a RATIONAL MIND. Why? This will benefit you, your family,
and the world. How can I cultivate it? Learn about the laws of logic.
They form the soil. Learn how to form logical arguments. Think
probabilistically. Think systemically. Think societally. Be ready to
give reasons. That is a dead giveaway that you are rational. Take
opportunities to ask yourself, “Why are you doing this?” “What purpose
does this serve?” How would you explain your motives it to a jury? A
judge? “What do you hope to achieve by doing this?” “What long-term goal
does this serve?” “What values does this demonstrate?” “What valued
qualities of action are exhibited by this behavior?”</li>
<li>Let go of the past. Forgive your dad. He was never an asshole. He
was just sometimes — unskillful. He was cursed with tender feelings and
an almost superhuman memory to go with it. That memory never allowed him
to forget past events. He never forgot when someone hurt him. He felt
hurt and wanted to act out revenge, to punish especially my mom. But he
also wanted to punish Uncle Bill and me and who knows who else. He at
all times must have considered his actions to be the right thing to
do.<br />
</li>
<li>Be present now. This note is evergreen. Do not pass it by as if it
is old and not relevant. Every single entry is forever relevant. When it
becomes irrelevant, remove it. Be bold with deletions. Thoughts grow on
trees. When they get wild you have to prune them.</li>
<li>Hope for the future. You might as well be optimistic. Optimism
motivates. Pessimism demotivates. Optimism increases energy. This
increases your chance of success. Optimism costs nothing. Its is simply
the will to say, “I might as well be optimistic.” It costs nothing bet
it confers benefits. It is irrational not to want to be optimistic.</li>
<li>Maybe there really is something to karma. But you don’t believe in
magic do you. Then what about the perversity of the universe? Is there
space in the yet unseen parts of the universe for karma?</li>
<li>Maybe good acts are music to the ears of the universe.<br />
</li>
<li>Speak the truth frankly. Do not evade things. Do not hint at them.
Say them. Say them directly and simply.</li>
<li>Procrastination is not “I’m never going to practice piano,” it is
“I’m definitely going to practice piano — tomorrow.”</li>
<li>This second you can sit down and do YOUR WORK.</li>
<li>Your desire to watch PORN is a manifestation of RESISTANCE —
resistance to doing YOUR WORK.</li>
<li>Other forms of RESISTANCE: ice cream, masturbation, TV, marijuana,
and unhealthy foods. Mindless reading. Mindless browsing. Wikipedia
rabbit holes.</li>
<li>When you accept cruelty from others, that is a form of RESISTANCE.
The WORK is to be assertive instead. Tell them you will not put up with
their cruelty.</li>
<li>Don’t cast yourself as a victim. That’s RESISTANCE. Do YOUR WORK.
It’s as simple as that.</li>
<li>An artist creates. A fundamentalist destroys. An artist is free. A
fundamentalist is not.</li>
<li>You are truly free only to the extent of your self-mastery. The body
sometimes rules the whole you. More self-mastery means more freedom.
Overcome RESISTANCE.</li>
<li>Harsh or unfair criticism of others is a form of RESISTANCE.
Encourage instead. Live as your authentic self. Harsh or unfair
criticism of others hurts you by revealing your meanness.</li>
<li>Look for what you are afraid of doing. That’s what you need to do.
The more fear the more resistance. The more resistance the more meaning.
Do what has meaning. That’s what you’re afraid of doing.</li>
<li>Do what’s right. Accept what happens. Speak the truth.</li>
<li>Concentrate on living right now — that’s all that can be lived.
Spend the time you have left being kind, modest, prudent, loyal, and
helpful. Favor the good of others over being proven right at any cost.
It took you years to realize this. You had to be right, and it has cost
you many times more than what it was worth.</li>
<li>“It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other
people, but care more about their opinion than our own.” Marcus said
this.</li>
<li>You matter more to you than anyone else.</li>
<li>Your opinions matter far more to you than anyone else’s. Why? They
affect your decisions. They inform and guide your behavior. Getting them
right is important. Other people have their own needs in mind.</li>
<li>No human does wrong on purpose. Those that do wrong do it by
ignorance. They are misguided. They think bad is good and good is
bad.</li>
<li>Things you did not expect do happen. Other things have happened
before. Why are you surprised? Everything changes, as you say.</li>
<li>Wisdom takes time to develop. Do not expect people to become wise
overnight. Rather plant seeds and water them.</li>
<li>Things independent of your will — may they not disturb you.</li>
<li>The discussion of philosophy, of right and wrong, of good and bad,
requires many words. Keep the long conversation going until you close
your eyes for the rest of time</li>
<li>Difficulties show you who you are.</li>
<li>RESISTANCE is fear. It’s secretly fear. It does not reveal its true
self. It’s cunning and subtle.</li>
<li>Aspects of life you look after: Emotional, Ethical, Financial,
Legal, Physical, and Social. Social includes all relationships with
others.</li>
<li>Show up every day to play piano. Show up no matter what. Stay
engaged all day. Focus on technique. This is a long marathon. Conserve
your energy. Be a mercenary. Be ready to suffer. Keep up the slog.<br />
</li>
<li>Put each artifact close to where you will use it. Put it near where
it will be needed. Put it within easy reach. Think ahead to the future.
Be realistic. If you do not predict you will use it, why keep it?</li>
<li>When you do Anki cards NEVER GUESS, BE SILENT. Guessing and getting
it wrong reinforces the wrong answer. It is better not to reinforce the
wrong answer. If you are silent, you do not reinforce the wrong answer.
When you reveal the answer, and read it, you practice the correct
answer.</li>
<li>Your integrity is your own. Someone else’s property is not yours.
This is the meaning of Epictetus when he said, “When you seek what is
not your own, you lose what is your own.” Don’t steal. Do the right
thing. Act with integrity. The same goes for another man’s wife,
someone’s girlfriend, someone’s idea, anything that is not yours.</li>
<li>THE LAW OF LIVING (TLOL): We must act conformably to nature.</li>
<li>“Who was ever taught the art of a pilot or music by anger? Do you
think by means of your anger I shall learn the art of life?”
Epictetus.</li>
<li>The world is a SHIT SHOW. But here’s the thing. It always has been.
Marcus said the same thing before 180 AD, and he said at that time it
was infinitely old. He predicted it would stay the same. It has. It
always will be. It turns out, in a case of irony, that the one thing
that unites all of us — every nationality or group of any kind — is the
SHIT SHOW. You an actor in the show and watching it at the same
time.</li>
<li>The SHIT SHOW is its own audience. The audience is the SHIT SHOW.
There is nobody else. There is the audience as SHIT SHOW and nobody else
is in the house.</li>
<li>Take what the day gives you.</li>
<li>Take committed action. That is, act to fulfill your commitments. You
said you would. Keep your word. That’s integrity.</li>
<li>This is an opportunity to strengthen the power of my patience.
Patience is a capability. It is a mindfulness exercise. It is a rational
exercise. It is a self control exercise. It is a discipline exercise.
Being patient is.</li>
<li>My children do not belong to me. My body does not belong to me. My
life does not belong to me. But my will belongs to me.</li>
<li>Live life fully. Pay out goodness like a chain.</li>
<li>DELAYED CONTINUITY. When practice piano, stop and listen. You will
found out a great deal about yourself.</li>
<li>Piano practice ritual: PLAN, PLAY, JUDGE. Think 10 times and play 1
time. Follow this persistently day by day, month by month, year by year.
Think back — that’s judgment. Think forward — that’s planning.</li>
<li>To think ahead when playing music is to “sing in your head
beforehand.”</li>
<li>May the thought never even occur to you that you know everything. To
be a professional, be a lifetime learner. Seek it eagerly.</li>
<li>Your body is the tool they gave you. Why? Let’s just say your
parents. Look at it coolly, impersonally, objectively.</li>
<li>A professional does not identify with their instrument — even when
their instrument is themself. Madonna does not walk around the house as
“Madonna.” Madonna employs “Madonna.”</li>
<li>“I am not better than you. You are not better than me. People are
incomparable.” A human has more facets than anything else. The
complexity of properties of one human being is infinite. So no two can
be compared. Each has unique, intrinsic value. None is better than
another. None is worse. We cannot rightly compare them at all. Treat
each as an individual.</li>
<li>Walk. It is wholesome. Walk with Julie. It is more wholesome.</li>
<li>Examine your life. Turn it over in your hands. See it from all
angles. Weigh it. Smell it. Taste it. Put it up to your chest. Kiss
it.</li>
<li>What aid can you find against habit? The contrary habit. This is
from Epictetus.</li>
<li>You cannot escape death. You can, however, escape the fear of
death.</li>
<li>You wish for something which doesn’t happen, and you feel bad about
it. Where does the problem lie? What could you do about it? What should
you do about it?</li>
<li>Approve or disapprove your behavior on a case by case basis. What is
a case? A case is the confluence of a scenario and an action — a scene
and an act. Never mind the result. The result depends on more than your
action. Your act is all that you own. It is all yours. You can answer
for it alone. What was the situation?</li>
<li>Here is how you judge one of your acts. Ask and answer these
questions. Be a detective. What was the situation or task? What was
known? What was unknown? What limited you? What action did you take? How
did I act? What did I say? What did I try to do? What were your motives?
Tell the truth. Tell the whole truth. Tell nothing but the truth. Why
not? It only you there in your skull with you. Now, be a judge. Put on
your robes. Under those circumstances, without adding anything, how do
you rate the action?</li>
<li>“Evolution has programmed us to feel rejection in our guts. This is
how the tribe enforced obedience, by wielding the threat of expulsion.
Fear of rejection isn’t just psychological; it’s biological. It’s in our
cells. Resistance knows this and uses it against us. It uses fear of
rejection to paralyze us and prevent us, if not from doing our work,
then from exposing it to public evaluation.” Steven Pressfield.</li>
<li>The system of roads and highways is a display of cooperation. From
the government workers that procured it to the engineers that designed
it to the contracting personnel that built it to the driving public to
the police, all are collaborating. All are cooperating.<br />
</li>
<li>To use the highways is to obey.</li>
<li>Shine your sink. It feels good. It makes you a little more tranquil.
Enjoy the satisfaction.</li>
<li>As a human you fear rejection. Can you set it aside to do what is
bold?</li>
<li>A professional stands apart from the performance, from the work. A
professional does not identify with it. Do not let external criticism
fortify the inner fear of rejection. This is paraphrased from
Pressfield. He adds, “The Bhagavad-Gita tells us we have a right only to
our labor, not to the fruits of our labor. “ This aligns perfectly with
Stoicism as expressed so well by Marcus.</li>
<li>Reread the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius. Study it. Get in there
and unravel it. It is pretty plain, though, so it does not need much
unraveling.</li>
<li>Self-validate. Where you fell short — improve. Where you triumphed —
make it even better. Show up tomorrow. Be a professional life
liver.</li>
<li>Watch for automatic reactions. Control your reactions. Govern your
emotions. Maintain sovereignty over the moment, over every moment.</li>
<li>Steven Pressfield wrote, “The professional learns to recognize
envy-driven criticism and to take it for what it is: the supreme
compliment. The critic hates most that which he would have done himself
if he had had the guts.” He means literary and art critics. Does the
same apply to the random Karen?</li>
<li>Try to treat other people the way they want to be treated. There are
limits to this. What are the limits? How do you recognize when a limit
has been approached?</li>
<li>Wear clothing appropriate for each occasion. Going into a crawl
space? Wear ratty jeans. Painting? Wear something you don’t mind if gets
splattered with paint. Wedding? Wear a suit.</li>
<li>Do not retreat from difficult situations.</li>
<li>Occasionally, let go of the story. Just let it go. It’s only words,
really. Come back to your body. Feel your body. Feel your heart. Feel
the earth supporting you. Return to now.</li>
<li>Problems are temporary, specific, and external. They are temporary
because everything is temporary. Everything changes. What concerned you
three years ago today? Who knows. Problems are specific, because they
always pertain to one situation, one aspect of life. Situations are
never exactly the same. Problems are never really general. And they are
external, because the things that cause problems are external.</li>
<li>When you speak, speak wisdom, kindly, respectfully, truthfully, and
at the appropriate time. What is the appropriate time? Say it when you
believe the person is receptive, willing to receive ideas that might be
wisdom.</li>
<li>Strengths of Wisdom and Knowledge: creativity, curiosity,
open-mindedness, love of learning, and perspective.</li>
<li>Your thinking is mostly unconscious. The conscious part is the top
of the iceberg. Much is hidden below the surface. Pressfields
Muses?</li>
<li>Zeno was right — happiness is a good flow of life. Spend your life
taking action in the direction of your values, harming nobody,
self-sufficient, surrounded by friends.</li>
<li>When you are being a perfectionist, your fear of disapproval leads
you to over extend and attempt to be so good at everything that you are
beyond reproach. That’s too hard to do! A better way is to make the
threshold for acceptability of your actions a private, internal concern.
You do not need to get approval from others. Your opinion of yourself is
enough. </li>
<li>Each action in life is a gamble under uncertainty. What does this
imply? What does it mean for your behavior?</li>
<li>Ways to organize a set of ideas in the Minto Pyramid Principle:
Chronologically (first, second, third), Comparatively (most important,
second most important, etc.), Deductively (premises, conclusion),
Inductively (ideas, plural noun summary), or Structurally (Boston, New
York, Washington)</li>
<li>Are you even in principle able to think that a thing is useful to
you and not choose it? Epictetus poses this.</li>
<li>EVIL BELIES IGNORANCE. All evil comes from thinking bad acts are
good. The mistake in categories (good and bad) is the source of the
evil. It is a judgment error. The evil results from poor judgment. This
is paraphrased from Epictetus.<br />
</li>
<li>DEPRESSION RISK ASSESSMENT. Watch for depression. It runs in the
family. Depression is not your fault. It is imposed upon you by nature
acting on conditions. You would not choose it. When it is present it is
because the conditions for it have arisen. Seek professional help
quickly and decisively. Do not relent in your battle against it.</li>
<li>GOOD IS INTERNAL. A law stated by Epictetus: “If you would have
anything good, receive it from yourself.”</li>
<li>“Nothing can conquer the will except the will itself.”
Epictetus.</li>
<li>PROFESSIONALS POLICY. You cannot be an expert at everything. Bring
in professionals and treat them with respect. You already have an
accountant. You have used lawyers in the past. Doctors count too.</li>
<li>When it feels like time for a big change, reincarnate. Transform
into someone or something new. Continue your journey.</li>
<li>DECISION PROCESS. Make decisions like this. Get something to write
with. Define the problem. Is there a problem? Where does the problem
lie? What is it you don’t like? What do you want instead? Now, look for
solutions. List as many as you can. Could this solve the problem? How
about this? What could we go about it? Next choose one. Choose the one
that you believe gives you the best chance of success. Let your right
brain participate in this. What should we do about it? Do it. Do the
thing you decided to do. If it’s a long project, write out a plan — as
steps, tasks, events — to implement the decision.</li>
<li>PLANNING PROCESS. Make plans. A plan is an expected and desired set
of steps. A step is an event requiring some kind of action. Think of
each step is a concrete action that produces a visible result in the
world. Think this way about plans. Put the steps in the proper logical
order. This cannot start until that is done. These two things can be
done in parallel.</li>
<li>If judging others is bad, it is bad when you judge others for
judging you. Have compassion for them. They do not yet understand it is
bad. They think it’s good. They think it’s good even if they say they
think it’s bad.</li>
<li>Your fuel tank contains ENERGY. Your level of energy affects your
performance and mood. How do you fill the tank? Fill your energy tank
using a combination of food, rest, and sleep.<br />
</li>
<li>RATIONAL THOUGHT is flexible, beneficial, helpful, true, and
logical.</li>
<li>IRRATIONAL THOUGHT is rigid, harmful, unhelpful, false, or
illogical.</li>
<li>Thought is only here to serve your interests. It is easy to change
your mind. It’s effortless even. So let it change. Let it adapt to the
new circumstances, this very moment. Let it be as flexible as
needed.</li>
<li>To cultivate PSYCHOLOGICAL FLEXIBILITY, be present, open up, and do
what matters.</li>
<li>To understand nature is to know its principles well enough to use
them for practical purposes.</li>
<li>A man steals a TV. The TV was not free. The man bought the TV at
this price: for a TV he became a thief. Adapted from Epictetus.</li>
<li>Everything which happens, if it be independent of your will, is
nothing to you. Epictetus.</li>
<li>“If you did not learn these things in order to show them in
practice, why did you learn them?” Epictetus.</li>
<li>Approach every event with confidence and caution — have confidence
in your own internal ability to act rightly. Use caution for those
things external to you that you do not control. Epictetus.</li>
<li>“There’s no mystery to turning pro. It’s a decision brought about by
an act of will. We make up our mind to view ourselves as pros and we do
it. Simple as that.” Steven Pressfield.</li>
<li>ART IS ABOUT THE WORK. “Why have I stressed professionalism so
heavily in the preceding chapters? Because the most important thing
about art is to work. Nothing else matters except sitting down every day
and trying.” Steven Pressfield.</li>
<li>TOP LEVEL DOMAINS OF KNOWLEDGE. Susan Gelman talks about three
domains of knowledge: Physical, Biological, Psychological Consider
adding: Social; Technological, and Metacogntive.</li>
<li>DEFINITION OF HOW. To harmonize with metaphors we live by, consider
“how” to mean “in what way”. Then the answer is steps.</li>
<li>Remember the STOCK AND FLOW schema. A bathtub is an ideal real world
example.</li>
<li>GALL’S LAW states, “Every complex system that works evolved from a
simpler system that worked.”</li>
<li>PURPOSE OF STOICISM. What was Epictetus preaching? Release from
perturbation, release from fear — freedom. It sound like Nibbana in
Buddhism.</li>
<li>DEFINITION OF FREEDOM. Epictetus says freedom is “the power of
living as we choose.” Do you agree? What would you add? Change? Take
away? Such persons, he says, being free have leisure. He then mentions
not all are qualified. Some are “too foolish to reckon consequences.” He
must mean the dull minded.</li>
<li>DEFINITION OF MATURITY. Maturity is another word for exercising your
sovereignty over yourself without outside control. You are mature when
you do what you think is right without obeying authority.</li>
<li>CAUTION AND COURAGE. Be cautious about how you act. Be courageous in
the face of life’s challenges. Epictetus.</li>
<li>Suppose you’re in a predicament. Something is at risk — money,
reputation, whatever. What do you keep in mind? Stay factual. Do not
spin stories. Tell things plainly like they are. Do the right thing, the
thing you would be proud of if Julie or your dad found out.</li>
<li>WILL CONFORMABLE TO NATURE. “Maintain a will conformable to nature.”
Epictetus. What does this mean to you? You can will something that is
not in your nature. Or you can will what is in your nature. Which do you
suppose works better? Now do the same with Julie, physical objects,
Tommy, crowds, Joey, and Dad. “I’ve decided never to get sick again” is
a counter-example. Better is, “I am willing to accept that illness
sometimes strikes; and when it does, I will still try to act
rightly.</li>
<li>LIFE IS BUT A PASSING HOUR. You are part of the whole world, as an
hour is part of a day. There is time before the hour. Then the hour is
present. And finally the hour is passed. You are the same. Your time in
the sun started on April 3, 1973. It will not continue forever. It
can’t.</li>
<li>MAN IS MADE FOR COOPERATION. You are not wholly a man if you are
separated from others. The complete man belongs with other humans.</li>
<li>If you are habitually angry, you become an angry man. Whatever you
habitually do you become. This is how your mind works. It happily
adjusts to what you are doing and then reinforces it later. Do good
works and your mind will conform to that instead.</li>
<li>Epictetus favored modesty, moderation, and gentleness. Emulate him.
They are somewhat in your control after all. No matter what happens to
you, you can maintain these qualities.</li>
<li>Epictetus says no man acts badly without harming himself. Do you
agree? He means by harming his own character.</li>
<li>To Epictetus bad behavior is that behavior which damages the person
doing it. “No man is bad without suffering some loss and damage.” To
retaliate, then, is to damage yourself. Avoid this. Let the other person
soil their character. Keep yours clean.</li>
<li>Steven Pressfield points to the Greek muses as a source of
inspiration for artist. He talks about how the muses live in eternity,
whereas human beings live in time. In his metaphor, the muses whisper
inspiration into the minds of humans living in time. This may well be
the experience of artists. Perhaps what Pressfield is talking about when
he discusses muses is the right side of the human brain. Maybe the
unconscious mind is the muse. That would be the naturalistic
interpretation of it. But the muses is a beautiful poetical vision of
the same thing that might do more good for some people to hear.</li>
<li>Pressfield talks of a divine realm and higher plains of existence.
He makes them noble and exalted. Could he be talking about stillness and
feeling of eternity? Could he mean glimpsing what Buddhists call
Nibbana? Is consciousness a part of natural reality like light and
gravity? Do we each carry a shard of this common universal
consciousness? The universe is strange.</li>
<li>Pressfield: “Concerning all acts of initiative (and creation)there
is one elementary truth, the ignorance of which kills countless ideas
and splendid plans: that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then
providence moves too. All sorts of things occur to help one that would
not otherwise have occurred. A whole stream of events issues from the
decision, raising in one’s favour all manner of unforeseen incidents and
meetings and material assistance which no man would have dreamed would
come his way.” In your vernacular this is another view of ACTION CREATES
TRACTION. Get up. Do the thing. Go do it. Write a program. Create a
podcast. Dream big and act boldly.</li>
<li>Pressfield: “Angels are like muses. They know stuff we don’t. They
want to help us. They’re on the other side of a pane of glass, shouting
to get our attention. But we can’t hear them. We’re too distracted by
our own nonsense.” This is probably the right brain but may be something
more significant if the hypothesis about consciousness being a
fundamental property of nature is onto something.</li>
<li>To get the help of his “angels”, Pressfield advises making a
beginning. This seems wise. If your dream is to play piano, you sit and
play the piano, and your subconscious mind takes note. It adds its
support to the endeavor. The more you work consciously, the more your
unconscious contributes. It’s BOGO for effort. Pressfield describes
this, saying, “When I finish a day’s work, I head up into the hills for
a hike. I take a pocket tape recorder because I know that as my surface
mind empties with the walk, another part of me will chime in and start
talking.” We see the wisdom that WALKING AND THINKING go together. We
will see this again.</li>
<li>On some level the human mind seems to operate by Gestalt psychology.
Keep this in mind as you traverse the world. Because of our limited
nature, we must sum up things to place our bets in the world. We sum
many things into one gestalt. Many people are held in mind as
“crowds.</li>
<li>User interface principles include (1) way finding, (2) feedback, (3)
visibility, (4) consistency. Way finding includes where you are, how you
can get out, where you can go, what’s nearby. Feedback includes status,
confirmation, warnings, errors. Car interfaces are masterful when it
comes to feedback. If someone enters June 31, make it July 1. Feedback
is a conversation between the user and the designer. Visibility of
feedback is important. Consistency is demonstrated by car models. The
brake is always on the left. The accelerator is on the right. Be
consistent with the other apps you use. Read the Apple Human Interface
Guidelines (“HIG”).</li>
<li>You have a mental model of a faucet. That model includes the layout
of the faucet and the system. It includes an interaction model. We
adjust the temperature and water flow with the handles.</li>
<li>INTUITIVE SYSTEM. When a system harmonizes with our mental model, we
consider that system “intuitive.”</li>
<li>MARIJUANA SEMAPHORE. Marijuana proves you are no sage — yet.
Marijuana reminds you that your soul needs more work done. There is work
to do. There is rest to not do.</li>
<li>Try 24 hours per week for outside work, 30 hours for leisure, and 20
hours for domestic work. See how it goes.</li>
<li>900 minutes is 15 hours.</li>
<li>Try 4-6 hours per day for outside work, 2-4 hours of chores and
family-related work, and 4-9 hours of leisure per day.</li>
<li>Try 240-350 minutes for outside work, 120-480 minutes for chores,
240-540 minutes for leisure.</li>
<li>Make an iPhone app to track the time commitments. It is a goal
stopwatch.</li>
<li>A nap is leisure. Exercise (for its own sake) is leisure. Reading is
leisure. Playing Angband is leisure.</li>
<li>Time engaged with philosophy is time not spent on something
unseemly.</li>
<li>Philosophizing that avoids something helpful is harmful. This is
called shirking. Philosophizing that avoids something harmful is
helpful. This is what renouncement looks like. Craving porn? Get up and
go for a walk. Read and write in this list. Read Logos again.</li>
<li>Explore. Go wandering sometimes. Tonight it was in search of serious
modern stoic philosophy.</li>
<li>Although stoicism is made up of physical, logic, and ethics, the
overarching goal of stoicism is ethical. Become virtuous, gain wisdom,
and therefore live a good life. Master all three to flourish.</li>
<li>The brain is the soul. It’s what animates the body. It has to be the
brain. It has to touch the body. The Stoics said the soul had to be
corporeal to interact with the corporeal body. Ta-da! The brain is
corporeal.</li>
<li>You are rational. Maggie is non-rational. The bulk of humanity falls
somewhere in between.</li>
<li>Let P be a proposition (claim). What stances can one have? Believe
P. Suspend P. Believe ~P. Suspend ~P. These are the four options. You
can assent to P. You can suspend judgment about P. You can assent to not
P while also suspending judgment about P.</li>
<li>Joeicism is the philosophy of Joe. Compare to Stoicism. “Joe is a
Joeic philosopher. “</li>
<li>Your rational faculty is bounded by the limited sensory input and
the limits of your brains cognitive powers. This is called BOUNDED
RATIONALITY. It is mentioned in the domain of economics.</li>
<li>Unseen forces work subconsciously on problems. Call it subconscious
thought. Call it unconsciousness thought. Call it a muse or an angel.
Call it the right brain. Whatever it is, enjoy it. Trust it. Let it work
magic.</li>
<li>A man is unjust to you. He has harmed himself by defecting against a
fellow human — you. Do you retaliate? Do you punish? No. That would harm
you. Let him harm himself. Instruct him if you can. But do not follow
his lead.</li>
<li>Epictetus says we have innate senses of what is good and evil,
beautiful and ugly, becoming and unbecoming, happy and unhappy, proper
and improper. Nature imbued you with these basics. It is your mammalian
inheritance.</li>
<li>Epictetus: pleasure is never secure. When you’re measuring good,
take pleasure off the scale and throw it out.</li>
<li>“To philosophize is this: to examine and conform the rules, then to
use them when they are known is the act of a wise and good man.”
Epictetus.</li>
<li>Think, act, observe. Think first about what you are going to do.
Then do it. Take action — act. Now observe the results, the
consequences, the outcome. This is a useful mental model.</li>
<li>When faced with any claim you have three options: agree, disagree,
or neither (suspend judgment). Both agree and disagree together is not
an option, unless you break up the claim into sub-claims.</li>
<li>The cycle of your life is conception, birth, death, and
annihilation. Conception and birth are obvious. Death is ceasing to live
but still remembered by the living. Annihilation is when your
personality is forgotten by the living. Annihilation is your ultimate
fate.</li>
<li>Epictetus: virtue produces tranquility.</li>
<li>PHILOSOPHICAL HUMILITY. Epictetus: “What is the first business of
him who philosophizes? To throw away self-conceit. For it is impossible
for a man to begin to learn that which he thinks that he knows.”</li>
<li>DANGER OF EXPECTATION. “I wish for something, and it does not
happen.” Epictetus points out as a great source of unhappiness and
misery. Buddhism would agree. This craving in Buddhism.</li>
<li>FIRST PRINCIPLE OF HABIT MAKING. Epictetus: habits are made by
corresponding actions. If you would be a writer, sit down and write. If
you would cultivate the habit of walking, go walk. “If you would make
anything a habit, do it. If you would not make it a habit, do not do it,
but accustom yourself to do something in place of it.” Epictetus.</li>
<li>SUPREME EMOTION. Pressfield: “The supreme emotion is love. Union and
mutual assistance are the imperatives of life. We are all in this
together.” This sounds very stoic. Can you explain why?</li>
<li>LIFT THINGS UP STANDARD. The minimum standard of care for looking
for an object in a household is to at least lift up a few things. If you
lift things up and still don’t find it, you met the standard. It’s about
effort. Put forth a little wise effort by picking up a few things and
looking under them.</li>
<li>GOALS HOME. Use Apple Reminders for goals, annual goals, checklists,
and list templates. Record gift ideas there.</li>
<li>MINDFUL PRACTICE. Practice piano mindfully. Feel your entire body.
Let the whole torso move around. Feel the pulse in your body. Tap your
left foot only. Work the pedal with the right foot. Try to be perfect —
play the perfect note. Do not allow errors. They ought to feel like an
electric shock punishment. Go as far as stopping entirely to find the
next chord or note. Repeat the same motion you want to learn. That’s how
you get good. That how you will grow as a player.</li>
<li>MINDFULNESS OF NEGATIVITY. Notice when you feel a negative feeling.
Just notice it. Do not try to control it. Just feel it like you would
feel the water in a pool. Do not judge it, positively or negatively.
Stop what you’re doing for a minute. Be interested in it.</li>
<li>PROCESS STEP SYNTAX. Outputs = Actor.action(inputs). The confluence
in time of the actor and inputs is an event. The action is what the
actor does to produce the outputs form the inputs. Action could be
“task” instead.</li>
<li>PURPOSE DISCOVERY. Pressfield: We cannot be anything we want. But
the mistake is to make yourself what you want to be. The better way is
to discover what you are. Tease it out. Then commit to it as a
professional.</li>
<li>HIERARCHY AND TERRITORY. Pressfield: there are two orientations to
the world. The default is to fit into a hierarchy. This is the wolf
mentality. The alternative is to connect to a territory. This is the
tiger mentality. As children we start with the hierarchy option. Only
later do we discover we can level up to the territorial option.</li>
<li>DEFINITION OF ACCOUNTING. Accounting simply means counting.</li>
<li>Your FAVORITE DICTIONARY is Websters 1913. It is far more elegant
and poetical than modern dictionaries.</li>
<li>UNFIXABLE ACCEPTANCE. If you cannot fix a problem, you might as well
accept that it exists. But do not be quick to declare a problem
unfixable. Be very slow to do so. Try out many options to fix it.</li>
<li>EFFORT CREATES ENERGY. Sometimes sleepiness is not sleepiness. It is
SLOTH AND TORPOR. This is a psychological state they don’t teach you
about as a kid. It is natural. Torpor feels similar to sleepiness, but
it is not about sleep. Sleep is a requirement of your animal body. On
the other hand, sloth and torpor is about evasion. It is about
avoidance. Doing something energetic is the way to know which is at
work. If it’s the middle of the day it’s likely sloth and torpor. Do
something energetic: calisthenics, weight training. Go for a walk. The
slight irony is you will feel more energetic having seemingly expended
energy. Effort creates energy.</li>
<li>FIVE AGGREGATES. Is your body you? Are you your body? Someday you
will die. On that day, the body will lie motionless, without breathing,
cooling to room temperature. It is not you. It is food for vultures. But
you say it was you before it died. No. It was only a part of what you
call “me”. You are at least the body plus it’s living vigor. But the
dead body also does not feel. So feeling is another part of you that is
not the body. But the dead body does not perceive the world. So
perception is another part of you, beyond the body. But the dead body is
not aware — not awake, not conscious. So conscious awareness is a part
of you, beyond the body. You see now your body is not you. And you are
not just your body, either.</li>
<li>When you express anger, you make expressing anger a habit. Don’t do
it. This takes practicing something else instead. We want to practice
NEUTRALIZING COUNTING.<br />
</li>
<li>ANGER SOBRIETY. Epictetus says to count the days you have been
without anger. Celebrate the accomplishment. Avoiding anger is a
victory.</li>
<li>UNSKILLFUL PRECURSORS. Avoiding unskillful lust is a victory. If you
do not wish to be an adulterer, harming your own character, then do not
do those things that are precursors to adultery. Do not let someone
else’s wife’s looks strike you. Do not imagine her stripping, getting in
bed with you. In short, do not fantasize about someone other than your
own beautiful wife. Lust for another leads to your affliction, to the
affliction of others (your wife, our kids, the other woman, her partner)
and to the affliction of both. It disgraces you, for it is within your
power. This was adapted from Epictetus.</li>
<li>SPEECH AND REALITY AGREEMENT STANDARD. Let your words agree with
your words harmonize with nature. Say what you have done, accurately.
Say what you have said, accurately. Watch out for your self-serving
bias! Notice when you subtly change your words to protect yourself. It
is better to be naked in the void.</li>
<li>BELIEFS REALLY MATTER. “To conclude, this comprehensive
meta-analysis investigated the robustness of the association between
irrational beliefs and various types of psychological distress: a test
of one of the major basic associations in modern psychology since the
cognitive revolution.  The results show that the overall strength of the
relationship between irrational beliefs and psychological distress
is modest; however, this relationship holds across different samples,
measurements, and study design.” Albert Ellis. This makes some sense.
The psychological state of an individual is probably determined by a
combination of genetics and non-genetic factors. If genetics are 40%,
one would think 60% includes things like diet, how tired you are, and
your system of beliefs. The system of beliefs is therefore probably 30%
or less at most.</li>
<li>PROSOCIAL SPEECH. “He avoids tale-bearing, and abstains from it.
What he has heard here, he does not repeat there, so as to cause
dissension there; and what he has heard there, he does not repeat here,
so as to cause dissension here. Thus he unites those that are divided;
and those that are united, he encourages. Concord gladdens him, he
delights and rejoices in concord; and it is concord that he spreads by
his words.” Read it again and love it more and more. Be this man! It is
very Stoic. Stoicism points out that humankind is made for cooperation.
So concord gladdens a Stoic.</li>
<li>Continue Language Transfer Spanish.Do not work from memory. Instead
think things through. Do it like you learn piano. Try to be perfect
early on. Take your time and think through the conjugation, whether it
is preterite (a point in time) or imperfect (a line across points in
time).

<li>PRIMACY OF SELF INTEREST. “Every animal is attached to nothing so
much as its own interest.” Epictetus. This is a good starting point for
human relations. But lest we despair at apparent selfishness recall that
two things are positive. First, it is in a persons interest to cooperate
with others. They might not know it but it is natural. Second, even self
interest leads to socially positive things. This is Adam Smith’s
“invisible hand.”</li>
<li>WILL TO VIRTUE. Epictetus: “If then I am there where my will is,
then only shall I be a friend such as I ought to be, and son, and
father; for this will be my interest, to maintain the character of
fidelity, of modesty, of patience, of abstinence, of active cooperation,
of observing my relations (towards all).” Here he lists some virtues
again: loyalty (fidelity), modesty, patience, abstinence (from vices),
active cooperation, and observing relationships (mindfulness).</li>
<li>HIERARCHY BY DEFAULT. Pressfield says the default organization
structure for humans is a hierarchy. It’s probably because of our past
as hunter gatherers in family bands. But this structure does not scale
well. At large numbers over maybe a thousand it is difficult to use. He
also says the artist cannot operate in a hierarchy. Why? The artist does
not get validation from others. The artist validated her own work. He
writes, “To labor in the arts for any reason other than love is
prostitution” and “In the hierarchy, the artist looks up and looks down.
The one place he can’t look is that place he must: within.”</li>
<li>What’s YOUR TURF? “We humans have territories too. Ours are
psychological. Stevie Wonder’s territory is the piano. Arnold
Schwarzenegger’s is the gym. When Bill Gates pulls into the parking lot
at Microsoft, he’s on his territory. When I sit down to write, I’m on
mine.” “A territory provides sustenance. Runners know what a territory
is. So do rock climbers and kayakers and yogis. Artists and
entrepreneurs know what a territory is.” Pressfield.</li>
<li>TURF IS EARNED. “TURF can only be claimed by WORK. When Arnold
Schwarzenegger hits the gym, he’s on his own turf. But what made it his
own are the hours and years of sweat he put in to claim it. A territory
doesn’t give, it gives back.” Pressfield.</li>
<li>CREATION IS GIVING. BIRTH METAPHOR. Pressfield describes the
artistic creative act like birth. What is produced is not from the
artist but through her — like a mother. She produces a baby through
powers beyond her control or comprehension. Yet she weeps at the miracle
and cherishes the offspring. So too the artist.</li>
<li>MAN IS A RATIONAL BEING. Be a man — the animal that uses its faculty
of reason to lift it above the other animals.</li>
<li>HARSHNESS PROHIBITION. Be harsh to no person — ideally.</li>
<li>GRATITUDE VALUE. May you feel gratitude.</li>
<li>GOVERNING FACULTY. RULE OF THE WILL. Epictetus: “Employ itself and
when not? what faculty is it which opens and closes the eyes, and turns
them away from objects to which it ought not to apply them and does
apply them to other objects? Is it the faculty of vision? No; but it is
the faculty of the WILL.” (My emphasis). This gives me an idea. If it is
right that we ultimately understand the world at a physical level as
discussed in Metaphors We Live By, then perhaps the will being described
so simply is all of it. The will directs the eyes. The focus of the eyes
is the focus of attention. To control the attention is the will.</li>
<li>WILL IS VISION. Exerting your WILL means directing your VISION. Your
vision might be immediate. It might be of something past or something
imagined that has not yet come to be. They are all forms of vision.
ATTENTION IS VISION to a large degree or maybe entirely.</li>
<li>PRICELESSNESS OF REASON. Reason is more important than any other of
the senses, any body part, even the body itself. For we can live and
even be happy without an arm, but without reason we are miserable — or
dead.</li>
<li>UNCONSTRAINED WILL The body is subject to constraint. The will is
not. Nothing can hinder the will except one thing — the will. Yes, only
the will can hinder the will. It hinders himself.</li>
<li>WILL TO GOODNESS. A right will creates a good man. A wrong will
creates a bad man.</li>
<li>SELF-REFERENTIAL NATURE OF LOGIC. Should anyone say, “Persuade me
that logic is necessary,” they are already preparing to rely on logic.
Epictetus would persuade them thus: you interlocutor need to use logic
to evaluate this argument I am making about logic. In this way you have
to accept logic even if I do not argue well. For you use it to see how
well I argued.</li>
<li>After a task is over, ask “What did I learn?” Write down your
answer. Add it to an Apple Note. Add it to Anki, a notepad, something.
Text it to someone. Make a record.</li>
<li>You can write thoughts here in approximate realtime, when you want
to.</li>
<li>HABIT SUBSTITUTION. To stop a bad habit, replace it with a good
activity. Repeat that enough and the good activity becomes the habit. So
when you feel yourself pulled to do the bad thing, go straight away and
do the good thing. Substitute one for the other.<br />
</li>
<li>DUELING IS IMPROVE Dueling pianos is improv. The piano playing is
improv. Learn the tricks of the trade. How do pros handle piano improv?
What are the rules of improv? Is there a way to How can we implement
those rules ourselves?</li>
<li>PERMISSION TO RELAX. When you’ve done your work for the day, relax.
Enjoy it. Take a break. Give yourself permission to relax.</li>
<li>LAST MAN ALIVE TEST. Pressfield: If you were the last man alive,
would you still do X? If yes, you are operating territorially — what he
recommends for pros. If not, you are operating hierarchally. If Billy
Joel was the last man on the planet you can bet he would play the piano.
It is his territory. He sustains himself with the act of playing and not
the plaudits it earns him.</li>
<li>WORK FOR ITS OWN SAKE. Pressfield: “We must do our work for its own
sake, not for fortune or attention or applause.”</li>
<li>AXIOM OF FORMAL AXIOLOGY. AXIOLOGICAL AXIOM. AXIOM OF SCIENCE OF
VALUE. AXIOM OF VALUE SCIENCE. Prune these later. Epictetus: ““Since we
see a dog naturally formed for one thing, and a horse for another, and
for another still, as an example, a nightingale, we may generally and
not improperly declare each of them to be beautiful then when it is most
excellent according to its nature.” This is Formal Axiology — the
Science of Value by Robert S. Hartman. “A thing is good to the degree it
exemplifies its concept.” The best horse exhibits the most horse nature.
One horse can run but not jump. Another can both run and jump. Which is
superior? It is obvious. Why is it obvious? Our human brains are
designed to think this way: add up the qualities for each. The one with
the most qualities wind.</li>
<li>FIRST KNOW THYSELF. “Know yourself.” Epictetus says this is written
above the entrance to a temple. Good advice.</li>
<li>PRAGMATIC VIEW OF RATIONAL THOUGHT. Epictetus: “rationally” means
“conformably to nature.” This is good. The natural use of a human brain
is to help its owner. Conform with nature and you help yourself. It is
when you do not conform with nature that trouble escalates.</li>
<li>SHIT HAPPENS. Anything you don’t do yourself falls under the rubric
“shit happens”. Abide and choose your next action wisely.</li>
<li>DICHOTOMY OF CONTROL. Stoics divide events into two broad
categories: those you can control and those you cannot control. Let
these be the CONTROLLABLE and the UNCONTROLLED.</li>
<li>Don’t form opinions about the UNCONTROLLED — those things
independent of the will. Accept them. They are nothing to you.</li>
<li>WISELY DIRECTED EFFORT. Epictetus: “Do not then mix things which are
different, and do not expect, when you are laboring at one thing, to
make progress in another.”</li>
<li>BE CONTENT WITH WHAY YOU HAVE. Epictetus: “Abstain from that which
belongs to others; no woman ought to seem beautiful to you except your
own wife.”</li>
<li>SKEPTICISM OF WEED. Does weed cause you any significant
problems?</li>
<li>BET-WAGER EQUIVALENCE ASSUMPTION. Unless otherwise stated “bet” is
interchangeable with “wager”.</li>
<li>29,000 DAYS. How many good days? More than enough. Be grateful.</li>
<li>SATISFICING is almost always good enough. It is probably always good
enough in our everyday lives. Maybe writing software or competing on
business leads to some optimizing.</li>
<li>THREE VIRTUES OF EPICTETUS. Epictetus admonishes to be free, noble,
and modest. As proof that such is our constitution as humans he points
out that only humans can blush.</li>
<li>RATIONAL LEADERSHIP. Epictetus: “‘But I can throw into prison any
man whom I please.’ So you can do with a stone. ‘But I can beat with
sticks whom I please.’ So you may an ass. This is not a governing of
men. Govern us as rational animals: show us what is profitable to us,
and we will follow it: show us what is unprofitable, and we will turn
away from it.” A good leader governs by persuasion with reason.</li>
<li>OPINION FACTOR “To every man the cause of his acting is opinion.”
Epictetus. He puts opinion first here. But what does he mean by the word
opinion? He seems to mean what cognitive behavioral therapies such as
REBT call “belief.” Stoic “opinion” is REBT “belief.”</li>
<li>SUMMARY NOUN PHRASE. Give each note a summary noun phrase like the
one here. When you read the noun phrase, you should be able to explain
what it means.</li>
<li>TRUE RICHNESS IS FREEDOM. For Epictetus a rich man is one who is
free from perturbations because he does not long for more than he has.
Even one with many more possessions but desiring more and more is poorer
than Epictetus who has almost no possessions but possesses firmness of
resolve and peace of mind. “Do not desire many things and you will have
what you want.”<br />
</li>
<li>PATIENCE. Epictetus: “To (children) who put their hand into a
narrow-necked earthen vessel and bring out figs and nuts, this happens:
if they fill the hand, they cannot take it out, and then they cry. Drop
a few of them and you will draw things out.”</li>
<li>SUPREME VIRTUE OF THE ARTIST. Pressfield says the supreme virtue of
an artist is “contempt for failure.”</li>
<li>DO OR DO NOT. Pressfield: “Are you a born writer? Were you put on
earth to be a painter, a scientist, an apostle of peace? In the end the
question can only be answered by action. Do it or don’t do it.”</li>
<li>GIFT OF CREATIVE WORKS. Pressfield: “Creative work is not a selfish
act or a bid for attention on the part of the actor. It’s a gift to the
world and every being in it. Don’ t cheat us of your contribution. Give
us what you’v e got.”</li>
<li>People collaborate when they have a COMMON PURPOSE. Is there any
other way short of coercion?</li>
<li>DAILY ASSESSMENT. “Let sleep not come upon thy languid eyes; Before
each daily action thou hast scann’d; What’s done amiss, what done, what
left undone; From first to last examine all, and then “What’s done
amiss, what done, what left undone; From first to last examine all, and
then; Blame what is wrong, in what is right rejoice.”</li>
<li>“For we ought to have these two principles in readiness: that except
the will nothing is good nor bad; and that we ought not to lead events,
but to follow them.” Epictetus.</li>
<li>Epictetus: “Walk alone and talk to yourself.” You do this regularly.
Keep it up.</li>
<li>Mindfulness is the awareness that arises from paying attention in
the present moment, on purpose, to body and mind, internally and
externally, without judgment.</li>
<li>The fundamental teaching of Buddhism is the “Four Noble
Truths.”</li>
<li>Basic decision model: For an action X: 1. Estimate costs. 2.
Estimate benefits. 3. If benefits &gt; costs, do it.</li>
<li>For a math or engineering calculation problem there are three
deliverables: (1) problem statement, (2) solution plan, and (3)
solution. Can this also be applied generally outside math?</li>
<li>Let UNCERTAINTY mean ignorance of future events.</li>
<li>ENERGY DEFINITION. Energy is the ability to do work.</li>
<li>PROBABILISTIC CAUSATION PRINCIPLE. Every cause and effect
relationship is probabilistic.</li>
<li>ORIGINALLY MEANT IS NOT REALLY MEANS. Interestingly the Websters
1913 dictionary has a definition of “computer”: one who computes.
Lesson: “originally meant X” does not equal “really means X”.</li>
<li>The habit of using and maintaining our TRIP CHECKLIST has made our
lives better. We forget things rarely. When we think of new things, we
keep it up to date.</li>
<li>Epictetus gave good advice about the NEWS. “When anything shall be
reported to you which is of a nature to disturb, have this principle in
readiness: that the news is about nothing which is within the power of
your will.”</li>
<li>GOOD AND BAD ARE OPINIONS. Health is not good nor sickness bad. How
you act when healthy can be judged good or bad, but good health is
neither. How you act when sick can be judged good or bad, but the
illness is neither.</li>
<li>NON-CRAVING AND NON-CLINGING. Epictetus: “Cease, I adjure you by the
gods, to admire material things. Cease to make yourselves slaves, first
of things, then, on account of things, slaves of those who are able to
give them or take them away.”</li>
<li>IRONY OF THE CHALLENGE. Someone tries your patience. Are they bad?
No they are good. By trying your patience they give you an opportunity
to practice it. This is true generally. A challenge to your reason lets
you strengthen your reason. A challenge to your self-discipline
strengthens that ability.</li>
<li>MISPLACED LOYALTY. Epictetus says about the Trojan war which started
with an adulterous affair in his typical practical sensibilities: “Was
it not a great gain to be derived of an adulterous wife?”</li>
<li>BEGIN WITH THE END IN MIND HABIT. Epictetus already knew “begin with
the end in mind” when he said, “First say to yourself who you wish to
be, then do accordingly what you are doing; for in nearly all other
things we see this to be so. Those who follow athletic exercises first
determine what they wish to be, then they do accordingly what
follows…For everything that we do, if we refer it to no end, we shall do
it to no purpose; and if we refer it to the wrong end, we shall miss the
mark.” You might change it to, “Begin with the right end in mind.”</li>
<li>Use MENTAL NOTING.</li>
<li>PURPOSE TEST. Before you do anything ask and answer: “What is the
purpose of doing this?” If you find no purpose do not proceed. But if
there is some purpose, next ask and answer: “Is this purpose worthy?”
The purpose is to achieve fame — this is not worthy. The purpose is to
benefit my family — this is worthy. Epictetus.</li>
<li>MINE-NOT MINE TEST. If can it be hindered, then it is not mine. If I
can be compelled to do it, then it is not mine. If I can be deprived of
it, then it is not mine. Epictetus.</li>
<li>RELATIONSHIP TIME LIMIT. It is not possible for one human being to
be with another always. Epictetus.</li>
<li>PRIME DIRECTIVE. Epictetus: “For what is that which every man seeks?
To live secure, to be happy, to do everything as he wishes, not to be
hindered, nor compelled.”Or LIBERTY. Epictetus.</li>
<li>FREE WILL. Epictetus: the desire to move is unhindered. It belongs
to you. However, the ability to move can be hindered. It does not belong
to you. Epictetus.</li>
<li>AGREEMENT WITH NATURE. Is it nature’s will that I have a fever
today? Then it is my will also. This is an example of aligning your will
with nature. Epictetus.</li>
<li>DEFINITION OF SCIENCE. The examination of the movements of nature
that we may better align our minds to its ways. Paraphrased from
Epictetus.</li>
<li>SEEK ONLY WHAT THE WILL CONTROLS. Why crave that which is beyond
your will? Do not lust, for sexual relations can be hindered by others.
But when you seek to fill your heart with kindness, nobody can hinder
you. Wealth is not under the control of the will. Do not seek it. But
seek loyalty and integrity. Nobody can hinder your will to be loyal.
Epictetus.</li>
<li>MEN ARE NOT PUNISHED FOR THEIR SINS BUT BY THEM. A man cannot do
what is unjust without suffering for it. The sentiment is from
Epictetus. The quotation is by one Elbert Hubbard.</li>
<li>INTEGRITY IS WORTH DYING FOR. Socrates sacrificed his body to
maintain his integrity. At first glance, this seems to be a waste. We
lost the body Socrates to poison. But look again. If he had lived, but
had sacrificed his integrity, we would have lost more. We would have
lost Socrates as a man. Because he saw this, he had to sacrifice himself
to save himself. And now this act benefits you and others in the world
by giving a wholesome example. Epictetus.</li>
<li>NON-ZERO COST. Epictetus: “Remember, nothing is done without cost.”
Is this axiomatically true? It reads like a maxim. Think of things that
can be done at no cost. How about breathing? It takes some energy to
breathe. That is a cost. While you’re breathing you cannot, for example,
blow up balloons. Here there is an opportunity cost: blowing up
balloons. So far the maxim seems to stand to scrutiny.</li>
<li>SIMULTANEOUS KNOWING. You breathe in and simultaneously know you’re
breathing in. You breathe out and simultaneously know you’re breathing
out.</li>
<li>GAIN SUPERSEDES LOSS. Epictetus: “Keep this thought in readiness
when you lose anything external: what you acquire in place of it; and if
it be worth more, never say, “I have had a loss.” He means because you
say the gain instead.</li>
<li>WRONGDOING HARMS THE WRONGDOER. “An act of injustice is a great harm
to him who does it.” Epictetus.</li>
<li>AVOID FIGHTS. Avoid fights. Avoid quarrels. Try to prevent others
from quarreling. Epictetus.</li>
<li>PRESENT ENJOYMENT OF THE IMPERMANENT. Enjoy the interaction, the
engagement, and pleasure of wife and kids. Accept that you can be
deprived of them at any time. This is a more peaceful way to be.</li>
<li>RIGHT OPINION consists of being content with what you are and easy
about what you are supposed (by others) to be. Epictetus.</li>
<li>What kind of animal are you? You are a RATIONAL ANIMAL. What then is
required of you? To reflect on your acts. Epictetus.</li>
<li>DEFINITION OF FUNCTION. A thing’s function is what it is used for by
humans — or at least by purposeful agents. This definition is better
than saying a things function is what it does. Let’s call that its
behavior instead.</li>
<li>PRAGMATIC MAXIM. All you know about something is what you know you
can do with it. That’s what Pragmatism postulates. Do you agree with it?
It seems to fit your belief system well. Does it extend to other humans?
Yes! What can I do with Julie? I can talk with her, work with her,
cuddle with her. That’s what I know about her. What’s in her head is off
limits.</li>
<li>BALANCED LIFE. A good life is one where you alternate between
meaningful activities. Spend some time working. This includes working
for others and self care. Spend some time resting. Spend some time
interacting with other people, especially in person. Spend some time
reflecting, thinking, and philosophizing. Neglect any of these to your
own detriment. Balance them. Do a little of each every day.</li>
<li>The Buddha said, “I do not see a single sight that occupies a man’s
mind like the sight of a woman. The sight of a woman occupies a man’s
mind.”</li>
<li>Have care for your emotional self, your ethical self, your financial
self, your legal self, your physical self, and your social self.</li>
<li>Aristotle thinks that eudaimonia is best achieved by a life of
virtuous action in accordance with reason. What would you say to
Aristotle?</li>
<li>Rational thinking accords with nature. The function of thinking is
to guide the thinker to act in its natural environment. Thinking that
does so is rational. Thoughts that accord with nature seem more likely
to result in helpful behaviors and so would be favored as
rational. </li>
<li>What are the four marks of a decision (process): Uncertainty; Risk;
Options; A decision maker.</li>
<li>Before you get going in the morning say to yourself, ‘Today I’ll
meet people who are meddlers, ingrates, bullies, cheaters, envious and
antisocial people. All of this happens because they don’t know the
difference between what’s good and what’s bad.’” Marcus Aurelius.</li>
<li>Walk. Walking is very wise use of your time.</li>
<li>I am humbly grateful for my life. I have loved and been loved.
That’s all there is.</li>
<li>What you know about time is what you can do with time. You can plan
with it. You can synchronize events. This helps with goal attainment.
You can measure temporal distance. You can measure time since an event.
This helps with planning.</li>
<li>Your mind — or soul if you prefer— is that which makes use of the
body. It understands. It selects and rejects. It can also be called the
“ruling faculty.” One faculty to rule them all. Epictetus.</li>
<li>A good singer demonstrates the qualities, the abilities of a good
singer. A bad singer lacks too many of those qualities. This is how
formal axiology is supposed to work.</li>
<li>Forbear what you can. Bear what you must. To forbear is to avoid, to
keep away from. To bear is to carry.</li>
<li>The difficulties of life are all about external things. Helplessness
is about externals. Epictetus.</li>
<li>If you want freedom from unhappiness, do not desire sex. It is not
in your power. Others can deprive you of it. What about masturbation?
Can it not also be deprived of you by your body’s state of health? Men
get erectile disfunction.</li>
<li>If you want to be free, do not try to avoid that which is not in
your power. Getting a cold is not in your power. Getting cancer is not
either. You want them not to happen and they do — this causes anguish.
It’s the confluence of two things: the physical growth in your body
called cancer and the terror of it. Let go of the terror. If it happens,
deal with it as best you can. And the door is always open.</li>
<li>“I wonder how it will be?” Nobody can say. But however it will be,
you will handle it with skill.</li>
<li>MOMENT OF DEATH TEST. “What then do you wish to be doing when you
are found by death?” Epictetus. This is an interesting and profound
question. If you want to be doing something noble, do something noble as
often as possible.</li>
<li>Epictetus said, “Death is the harbor for all.”</li>
<li>Epictetus said, “Now the acts of the soul are movement towards an
object or movement from it, desire, aversion, preparation, design
(purpose), assent.” Do you agree with him? Is this list
all-encompassing? What else can one do?</li>
<li>“The soul is pure which has proper opinions. Impurity of the soul is
the souls bad opinions.” Epictetus.</li>
<li>What is a bad opinion?</li>
<li>A human life is 29,000 days.</li>
<li>ANXIETY is long-acting, future-focused, broadly focused towards a
diffuse threat, and promoting excessive caution while approaching a
potential threat and interferes with constructive coping.</li>
<li>Believe the most what you doubt the least.</li>
<li>Epictetus: “What then? is it possible to be free from faults? It is
not possible; but this is possible: to direct your efforts incessantly
to being faultless.” Always try to be faultless, knowing you never can.
This seems to be virtue.</li>
<li>Let reason be your guide. Follow your reason as far as it will take
you. Arrange your life according to it.</li>
<li>If you want to live, learn. If you want to learn, live.</li>
<li>If you are indifferent to two choices, pick the one that leaves open
the greatest future options. PRESERVING OPTIONALITY.</li>
<li>Reduce waste. Notice wastefulness. Think about how to reduce waste.
Take action to reduce waste. Reflect to see if your action reduced
waste. What can be wasted?</li>
<li>Think about the function of the word better. Notice how other people
use it. Notice how you use it. Use it simply without over analyzing.
Does it mean “more good”? What about “closer to perfection”?</li>
<li>Consider what your body needs. Consider what your mind needs.
Consider what your heart needs. Plan and act according to these needs.
Work to satisfy your needs.</li>
<li>Exercise your free will. For one thing, select your own values. Do
not let other people select them. Value the flexibility of free
will.</li>
<li>Think about how you will decide to give preference to one value when
it conflicts with another.</li>
<li>With these values in mind, set goals. Decide how to prioritize your
goals. Adapt them when the situation changes. Expect the situation to
change and hence changes to be needed to your plans. Keep plans
flexible. Be flexible in general. Be psychologically flexible. Be ready
and willing to change your mind. Be physically flexible. Exercise
regularly. Stretch regularly. Use relaxation methods regularly. Meditate
regularly. Give yourself the go ahead to spend time caring for
yourself.</li>
<li>Allow yourself to rest. Spend some of your time doing nothing. Find
the sweet spot between productive and lazy that makes life at least
tolerable and even enjoyable.</li>
<li>Now do what serves your goals, which in turn take you toward your
values. Treat a goal as a step along the way. Treat a value as a
direction.</li>
<li>Be pragmatic. Adopt the philosophy of pragmatism. Adopt the
philosophy of practical application. Learn things in order to use them
actively in the real world. Learn a programming language to actually
write programs. Learn philosophy to improve life skills. Use your brain
for its function: to guide your actions. Take action to live life. Think
about what serves your ability to act.</li>
<li>Abandon thoughts that move you a direction away from a value. Say,
“I do not want to go where that idea leads”.</li>
<li>Take it for granted that change will occur. Expect change. Embrace
change. When planning, expect change. When dealing with others, expect
change. When working, expect change. When driving, expect change.</li>
<li>Think about the implications of all this change. Relax and accept
it. Fight bad things that can be changed. Doing that is noble. Fight not
change itself. Doing that is folly.</li>
<li>Value doing what works to move you toward your goals in the
direction of your values. Devalue what does not work. Devalue goals that
do not point toward your values. Avoid the contradiction of devaluing
your values. Value what you value, nothing else.</li>
<li>Do not punch a tree. Do not kick an anvil. Do not expect to be
exempt from natural law. Take the law into consideration. Assume natural
law is perfect. Assume your understanding of natural laws is imperfect
and wildly incomplete. Assume our human-made laws, the ones we rely on
for our interdependence, are imperfect. Continually revise and adapt
them.</li>
<li>Treat the map as different from the territory. Treat human theories
as different from the physical laws they describe. Treat the theory as
the map and physical laws as the territory. Treat the world of human
thought different than the real world represented by the thoughts.</li>
<li>Accept the laws of nature. Accept that you do not understand most if
not all of them. To use something, come to understand it.</li>
<li>PRAGMATIC VIEW OF TIME. Treat time as a dimension of the space time
of the universe, not something besides the spatial dimensions. Do this
when it is appropriate to do this. When it benefits you to split the two
up, split the two up. Measure time with a clock.</li>
<li>DEFINITION OF CLOCK. A clock is that which measures time.</li>
<li>Admit you cannot predict the precise outcome of each decision you
make. Admit you don’t even remember every decision you make. Have
humility about what you can control in the world. Admit the
insignificance of the levers you can pull, in the big scheme of
things.</li>
<li>Submit always to the power of natural law. Think about why this is
wise advice. Jacob wrestled god and won. You cannot wrestle nature and
win.</li>
<li>NATURAL LAW HUMILITY. You can be too certain about your natural
laws. Remember they are tentative. Humans cannot do the impossible with
their brains.</li>
<li>On the other hand, submit to human law only when it is useful to you
in the real world. Remember you operate in the real world. Do not
pretend you operate somewhere other than the real world. Devalue human
laws that are not useful or are even harmful. But consider the
inconvenience of potential incarceration or other penalties under human
law before you break any human laws. Attempts to break natural laws will
instead break you — naturally.</li>
<li>Treat time like a precious, limited resource. Do not waste time
trying to resist an irresistible force. Do not spend time trying the
impossible. Remember you cannot be 100% sure what is possible. Try new
things that stretch possibilities. Be flexible in your beliefs about
what is possible.</li>
<li>Do not try what you strongly believe is impossible, but do try what
you think is possible, at least when it points you toward a value. Point
yourself toward your values and move toward your goals. Imagine your
goals out there, in front of you, in the direction of your values.</li>
<li>Use the concept of a bet to clarify your beliefs. Believe only
things you are willing to bet on. Bet on things you believe to be true.
When you bet, bet something of value to you. Be ready to lose that thing
of value. Notice your actions are gambles. Notice how many other things
combine with your actions to produce outcomes. Notice how few you
control (hint: maybe none).</li>
<li>Choose or at least recognize your personal level of risk tolerance
at this moment. And expect your risk tolerance to change. Let risk
tolerance change to adapt to changes in the world.</li>
<li>Remember this moment is where everything happens. Treat the thoughts
as the map, and treat this moment as the territory. Use the map of your
belief system to navigate the territory that is reality in this moment.
Always align your belief system with the direction of natural laws. Only
align your belief system with human laws when it is useful to do
it.</li>
<li>Never regret. Grow as a person instead. Gain wisdom. Formulate the
wisdom into claims. Treat the word wisdom as “knowing how the real world
really works.” Notice the emphasis on “real.” Allow reality to emphasize
itself. Avoid deemphasizing reality.</li>
<li>Try to give advice in terms of concrete action. Start abstract if
you must to make for easy understanding. Keep explaining and breaking
down the advice. Stop only when the advice becomes real world action.
Write it down here. Write it in Anki cards.</li>
<li>Use English in ways that serve your goals and values. When
uncertain, default to short, common, easily recognized words and simple,
short, easy to understand sentences. Favor older, shorter words. Way is
better than direction.</li>
<li>Think in systems when it is helpful to think in systems. Think of a
system as a whole made up of parts. Notice parts can also be systems.
Use words similar to the word part: component, subcomponent, subsystem,
element, unit, facility, device.</li>
<li>Consider too mass nouns: ingredient, portion, fraction.</li>
<li>Use names for collective parts of organizations: department, unit,
company, affiliate, enterprise, team, group, agency, government,
community, committee, subcommittee, council, band, society, field,
discipline, league, division, board, workgroup, crew.</li>
<li>Use names for individuals within organizations: team member, member,
officer, employee, volunteer, player, leader, captain, crew member,
musician, participant, actor, teammate, worker, supervisor, helper,
laborer, driver, trainee, staffer.</li>
<li>Notice how humans are designed for talking. Look at the structure of
the human body. See it has ears, vocal cords, a mouth, a tongue, and a
brain all fitted for talking and listening to others talk. Make talking
your primary form of communication. Get good at talking. Then write like
you talk. Write in an easy, relaxed manner. Write at a pace that seems
like talking. Read your writing out loud. See if it works that way.</li>
<li>Make sense when you talk. State out loud what is believed. Admit
uncertainties.</li>
<li>If you think someone will probably say no to your request, ask
anyway. Do not say no to yourself on their behalf. Let them do it if
they want to. Remember they might say yes. Have some humility about your
ability to predict what others will do.</li>
<li>Guard against perfectionism. Notice it when it appears. Allow
failure. Allow yourself to lose. Accept you will lose and fail on some
attempts. Accept disappointments, setbacks, mistakes, defeats, screwups,
misfortunes, blunders, wrong turns.</li>
<li>Notice what it feels like to help someone without expectation of
reciprocity.</li>
<li>Help people. Attempt to treat people the way they want to be
treated. Give things to others. Be generous with your time. Share the
things you have. Share your wisdom. Share food. Share moments. Share
experiences. Care about others and care for others.</li>
<li>Make yourself your first priority and your loved ones a very close
second. Put on your oxygen mask before helping others.</li>
<li>Model the behaviors you would like to see in others.</li>
<li>Do not let fear paralyze you. Allow yourself to feel concern. Notice
when concern turns to worry. Notice when worry turns to anxiety, then to
panic. Notice what worry feels like. See if the worry is workable. Learn
how to deal with fear. Learn when to allow it. Learn when to challenge
it. Learn how to argue with irrational beliefs that lead to irrational
fears.</li>
<li>Cultivate excitement. Value excitement for what’s wholesome. Devalue
excitement for what’s not wholesome.</li>
<li>Be adaptable. Adapt when it makes sense to adapt. Call it
flexibility.</li>
<li>Set goals in the direction of your values. Take action in the
direction of your goals. Celebrate when you achieve a goal. Allow
yourself to fail at reaching a goal. Learn from failures. This is key.
Do an autopsy. Adapt goals when the situation changes and adapt goals as
you yourself change.</li>
<li>Choose your next action with due consideration for your current
state of mind and level of energy.</li>
<li>Your character is strong when you exhibit all these virtues:
Strengths of Character: Courage, Humanity, Justice, Temperance,
Transcendence, Wisdom and Knowledge</li>
<li>Jon Kabat-Zinn: Kabat-Zinn: “Any moment is the perfect moment for
being fully present.”</li>
<li>Courage is the halfway mark between cowardice and recklessness.</li>
<li>It you want to understand your mind, sit down and observe it. This
is one form a meditation.</li>
<li>The PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE says to pause and thing about it before
doing something radical or risky.</li>
<li>A thing is worth only what someone else will pay for it.</li>
<li>Epictetus: “Nothing great is produced suddenly.”</li>
<li>Buddha: “He avoids vain talk, and abstains from it. He speaks at
the right time, in accordance with facts, speaks what is useful, speaks
of the law and the discipline: his speech is like a treasure, uttered at
the right moment, accompanied by arguments, moderate, and full of
sense.” Aspire to be like the man he describes.</li>
<li>In simple English, a LOSS is a taking away. An event takes away
something you had. It is an event with a negative emotional
valence.</li>
<li>The two valences are positive and negative. The three valences are
positive, neutral, and negative.</li>
<li>GRIEF is the emotional response to LOSS.</li>
<li>Use SHOW instead of demonstrate, depict, denote, disclose, indicate,
represent, illustrate, evince, establish.</li>
<li>Write in PLAIN ENGLISH. Use common words and phrases.</li>
<li>Writing is for the benefit of the reader. Who benefits from reading
this or that? They are the audience.</li>
<li>More than anything else, harshness creates ill will and amplifies
ill will.</li>
<li>MEET A GOAL. Do you prefer the phrase “meet a goal” to “achieve a
goal”? If a GOAL IS A PLACE WHERE YOU STOP, the metaphor is that you
arrive there and “meet” this place. If there was a sign post, you would
walk up your it like you’re meeting another person standing there.</li>
<li>DUELING PIANOS WORK PRODUCTS. What are the work products of a
dueling piano show? Music? Entertainment? License to sing (especially if
bad)?</li>
<li>DEFINITION OF MOTIVATION. The activation of goal-oriented
behavior.</li>
<li>DEFINITION OF HYPERBOLE. Using wild exaggeration for rhetorical or
comedic effect. “She had a million things to do”.</li>
<li>MADMAN. ARCHITECT. CARPENTER. JUDGE. Points to make. Arrangement of
points to make. Draft. Final judgment.</li>
<li>How do I achieve an acceptable design of a rectangular footing? What
are the requirements to be met? What is required for soil bearing
pressure? What about uplift? What are concrete design requirements?
Where are requirements specified?</li>
<li>FUZZY DEFINITION OF HEAVY. Suppose you balance a weight on a board
on your chest. It weighs 200 pounds. You would say it’s heavy. Now let’s
try a thought experiment. You set up a bucket on your chest. One by one
you fill it with quarters until it reaches 200 pounds. If a quarter
weighs only 0.0125 pounds, it takes 80 to make a pound, and 16,000 to
make 200 pounds. How many coins in is considered “heavy”? Not everyone
would agree.</li>
<li>THINK FOR YOURSELF. This is full of good advice. It can mean, “Be
independent, sovereign.” It can mean, “Think to benefit yourself.” It
can mean, “Be free.” And here’s a bonus: it’s the only fully reliable
freedom you have. Freedom to move the body is subject to the will of
others. The mind is always free to move itself. It has infinite degrees
of freedom.</li>
<li>MIND-STRUCTURE METAPHOR. The mind is a structure. It has
subassemblies, members, elements. And it resists loads. The stress of a
deadline is a load the mind bears. What can we learn from the
metaphorical entailment of, say, a building on the human mind?</li>
<li>ESSENCE OF ASSERTIVENESS: EQUALITY. Assertiveness is about equality:
Equal dignity, Equal rights, Political equality, Equality under the law,
Equal treatment, Equal value, Right to be treated as an individual, and
Freedom: of Thought, religion, Expression.</li>
<li>EXAMPLE of LOGICAL ARGUMENTATION. Let’s see if we can argue this
claim from other claims: It’s perfectly okay to talk to yourself — out
loud. Is this controversial? In pop culture and in regular life people
sometimes frown upon talking out loud to yourself. On the other hand,
nobody seems to complain if you think to yourself. But here’s an
insight: when you do what we call “thinking ,” what you really do is
talk to yourself inside your head. You even subconsciously move some
muscles that control speech. Other evidence for this is in child
development. When children first start talking, it is all out loud. They
talk to others and also talk out loud to themselves. But probably
because of pressure to conform, as they get older, this external
self-directed talk gets internalized. There is even a transition period
during which the child will let slip a few words while most of their
self talk is silent and internal. So by the transitive property of
equality, which says “if A = B and B = C then A = C,” we can say the
following. Let A = okay. Let B = thinking to yourself. Let C = talking
to yourself. Now, A = B, because it is okay to think to yourself. And B
= C because thinking is self-talk. Therefore A = C: it is okay to talk
to yourself.</li>
