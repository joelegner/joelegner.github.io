    The author does not agree with everything on this site. There are
    errors in it. For example, it derides agnosticism by saying it is
    “an example of the evasion of the Law of Excluded Middle.” The Law
    of Excluded Middle comes from Aristotle and says, “A proposition
    either is true or is false, not neither and not both.” There is no
    middle ground. But another way to view agnosticism is that it is
    about reserving judgement. If we commit to the Law of Excluded
    Middle and apply it to the concept of god, we might rightly say, “By
    the Law of Excluded middle, it is true that either (1) god exists or
    (2) god does not exist. There is no third option.” Agnosticism does
    not deny this. But it adds, “However, I do not personally know the
    answer to whether god exists or does not exist.” The website seems
    to say that the fact that the idea “god” is floating around in the
    universe makes it mandatory that anyone considering things must fall
    on one side of the argument or the other or somehow their refusal to
    do so is an evasion–a word used in a derogatory manner. Nonsense.
    It’s perfectly reasonable to suspend disbelief in the absence of
    sufficient evidence. We can see this by applying it to something
    less devisive: the existence of intelligent alien life. The Law of
    Excluded Middle requires that either one of the two propositions is
    true: (1) there are intelligent aliens, or (2) there are no
    intelligent aliens. But nowhere in the The Law of Excluded Middle
    does it say thinking, rational creature must assent to one or the
    other position. The right thing to do when evidence is not
    convincing is to neither believe nor disbelieve. That’s agnosticism.
    There is still a lot of useful material on the site, but use it with
    caution.</li>
