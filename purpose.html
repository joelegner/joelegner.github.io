    <p>I want to contribute to helping the world by improving my own
    thinking. When I think clearly, I make better decisions. When I make
    better decisions, favorable outcomes become more likely. Doing
    things that increase the frequency of desirable outcomes seems like
    a good use of my time.</p>
